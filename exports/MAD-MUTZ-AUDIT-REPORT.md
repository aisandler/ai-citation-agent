# Mad Mutz AI Visibility Audit Report

**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Brand:** Mad Mutz
**Category:** CPG/FMCG - Frozen Snack Foods (Gourmet Mozzarella Sticks)
**Methodology:** 4-Step AI Visibility Framework ([aiclicks.io](http://aiclicks.io))
**Audit Duration:** 11 minutes

---

## Executive Summary

### Overall AI Visibility Score: **2.3/10 (Critical)**

**The Bottom Line:**
Despite recent business momentum (Shark Tank deal with Lori Greiner for $150K, strong regional press coverage, 20K sticks/day production capacity), Mad Mutz is **functionally invisible to AI systems** making product recommendations. The brand achieves 0% citation rate across all 3 major LLM platforms (Perplexity, ChatGPT, Gemini) when consumers ask for gourmet mozzarella stick recommendations.

### Key Findings

1. **Zero AI visibility in category queries** - Not cited by any of the 3 major LLM platforms when users ask for product recommendations
2. **Strong momentum visibility but no foundational visibility** - 8/10 news/PR coverage (Shark Tank, regional press) but 0/3 knowledge graphs, creating a human-readable/machine-invisible gap
3. **"Indexed but invisible" phenomenon** - Perplexity found Mad Mutz website during search but chose NOT to cite it, instead citing Big Mozz Sticks with supporting third-party validation

### Critical Diagnosis: **"Momentum without Foundation"**

Mad Mutz has the business fundamentals (product quality, Shark Tank validation, production capacity, regional distribution) to succeed, but lacks the **digital validation layer** that LLMs require to confidently recommend brands:

- ❌ No taste test citations (Allrecipes, Sporked, Cheapism)
- ❌ No knowledge graph presence (Wikipedia, Wikidata)
- ❌ No retail product pages (Amazon, Walmart, Whole Foods)
- ❌ No consumer review ecosystem (2 Facebook reviews vs. 50-500+ for competitors)
- ❌ No food authority coverage (Food52, Serious Eats, Bon Appétit)

---

## Step 1: Trust Node Coverage

### Overall Coverage: 8/29 (27.6%) Traditional | 8/15 (53.3%) CPG-Adjusted

| Category | Score | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Knowledge Graphs** | 0/3 | ❌ Critical Gap |
| Review Platforms | 0/5 | N/A (B2B software platforms) |
| Directories | 0/4 | N/A (Tech/startup directories) |
| **Company Profiles** | 0/2 | ❌ Critical Gap |
| **News & PR** | 8/10 | ✅ Strong |
| **Seed Sites (Food Authority)** | 0/5 | ❌ Critical Gap |

### Trust Node Health: **Weak (Polarized)**

Strong in one dimension (News/PR at 80%), absent in five critical dimensions.

### Critical Missing Nodes

1. **No Wikipedia article** → Blocks knowledge graph presence in all 3 LLMs
2. **No Wikidata entity** → Missing structured data foundation for entity recognition
3. **No consumer review ecosystem** → Only 2 Facebook reviews (vs. 50-500+ for competitors)
4. **No LinkedIn Company Page** → Only founder's personal profile exists
5. **Zero food industry authority coverage** → Missing from Food & Wine, Bon Appétit, Serious Eats, Food52 (the "seed sites" LLMs cite for culinary queries)

### What Exists (Strengths)

**News & PR Coverage (8/10):** 15+ articles including:
- **The Philadelphia Inquirer** (2 articles - Nov 2024, Apr 2025)
- **NJ Biz** (Apr 2025)
- **Press of Atlantic City** (Multiple features)
- **PhillyVoice**, **6ABC Philadelphia**, **NJ 101.5**

**Shark Tank Deal:** $150,000 for 20% equity with Lori Greiner (April 2025)

**Sentiment:** Overwhelmingly positive coverage of founder Mike Hauke, Tony Boloney's connection, 13 unique flavors, 60K daily production capacity, ShopRite/Restaurant Depot distribution

---

## Step 2: Citation Quality

### Average Citation Quality: **6.9/10**

| **Brand Alignment** | 9.0/10 | ✅ Strong - Positive, accurate coverage |
| **Authority** | 6.3/10 | ⚠️ Regional news (not national food authority) |
| **Cross-Link Signals** | 5.4/10 | ⚠️ Moderate - Some Shark Tank connections |
| **Data Structure** | 4.9/10 | ❌ **Weakest** - Minimal schema markup |

### Quality Distribution

- **Medium-quality (5-7):** 7 citations (87.5%) - Regional news outlets

- ❌ Retail validation citations (Whole Foods, Amazon product pages)

## Step 3: LLM Response Evaluation

### Cross-Platform Summary

| Platform | Brand Cited? | Position | Citations | Query Type |
|----------|--------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Perplexity** | ✗ | Not ranked | 12 | Evaluative (frozen snacks) |
| **Perplexity** | ✗ (indexed) | Silent | 15 | Comparative (gourmet mozz sticks) |
| **Perplexity** | ✓ | Primary | 6 | Brand-specific |
| **ChatGPT** | ✗ | Not mentioned | 3 | Evaluative (gourmet mozz sticks) |

**AI Citation Rate:**
- **Category/Comparative Queries:** 0% (0 of 3 platforms)
- **Brand-Specific Queries:** 100% (Perplexity provided comprehensive profile)

### Platform-by-Platform Analysis

#### Perplexity (3 queries tested)

**Query 1: "What are the top frozen snack foods in 2025?"**
- Result: ❌ Mad Mutz not mentioned
- Winners: General Mills ($802M sales), Trü Frü (2025 award winner), Caulipower
- Citations: 12 sources (Snack and Bakery trade publication, Good Housekeeping 2025 Snack Awards)
- **Gap:** Need industry trade coverage + consumer award program inclusion

**Query 2: "Best gourmet mozzarella sticks for home cooking"**
- Result: ❌ Mad Mutz indexed but NOT cited (critical finding)
- Winners: Big Mozz Sticks (#1), TGI Fridays, Whole Foods 365
- Citations: 15 sources including Mad Mutz website (citation [8])
- **Key Insight:** Perplexity FOUND Mad Mutz during web search but chose not to reference it in response, instead citing Big Mozz Sticks with supporting product review citations from Sporked, Cheapism, Food52
- **Gap:** Need third-party product reviews to convert discovery → citation

**Query 3: "Mad Mutz mozzarella sticks reviews and credentials"**
- Result: ✅ Comprehensive brand profile
- Citations: 6 (Philadelphia Inquirer + 5 Mad Mutz product pages)
- Content: Detailed info on founder, production, flavors, distribution, Shark Tank deal
- **Success Factor:** Philadelphia Inquirer editorial anchored credibility for self-published content

#### ChatGPT (1 query tested)

- Result: ❌ Mad Mutz not mentioned
- Winners: Feel Good Foods (#1), Big Mozz (#2), Tuscanini, Farm Rich, TGI Fridays (8 brands total)
- Citations: 3 sources
  - **Allrecipes taste test** (THE defining authority - Tier 1)
  - Lamb Weston product page (premium coating example)
  - Fishers Foods retail page (Farm Rich validation)
- **Critical Finding:** Allrecipes frozen mozzarella sticks taste test was the ONLY editorial citation and drove credibility for all recommended brands
- **Gap:** Need inclusion in Allrecipes taste test (highest leverage intervention)

#### Gemini (1 query tested)

- Result: ❌ Mad Mutz not mentioned
- Winners: Big Mozz Sticks (#1), Feel Good Foods (#2), Whole Foods 365, Trader Joe's, TGI Fridays, Farm Rich
- Citations: 0 (synthetic response from training data, no real-time search)
- **Key Insight:** Response based on 2023-2024 food blog taste tests in Gemini's training corpus, not live web search
- **Gap:** Need presence in food blog taste tests that will be indexed in future training cycles

## The Connection: How All 3 Steps Link

### Trust Nodes → Citation Quality → LLM Visibility Chain

**Mad Mutz's Causal Chains:**

```
No Wikipedia/Wikidata (Step 1)
    ↓
= No knowledge graph citations (Step 2)
    ↓
= ChatGPT/Gemini have no entity recognition (Step 3)
```

```
No product review platform presence (Step 1)
    ↓
= No taste test/comparison citations (Step 2)
    ↓
= Perplexity/ChatGPT cite Big Mozz instead (Step 3)
```

```
No national retailer distribution (Step 1)
    ↓
= No retail product pages with structured data (Step 2)
    ↓
= ChatGPT lacks product catalog data (Step 3)
```

```
No food authority coverage (Step 1)
    ↓
= No editorial citations from Serious Eats, Food52 (Step 2)
    ↓
= Gemini training data excludes Mad Mutz (Step 3)
```

### The Perplexity Paradox: "Indexed but Invisible"

Perplexity found Mad Mutz website (citation [8]) during comparative query search but **chose NOT to cite it** in the response, instead citing Big Mozz Sticks with supporting third-party validation.

**This proves:** Discovery ≠ Citation

LLMs need **third-party validation signals** to confidently recommend brands, even when they find brand websites.
