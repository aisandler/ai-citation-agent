# AI SEO Optimization Framework
*Source: AI SEO Strategy Session (October 2024)*

## Overview
This framework guides how we optimize content for AI search platforms (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini) to increase citation frequency and improve positioning.

---

## The Four Pillars

### 1. Entity-First Approach
Structure all content around clearly defined entities with explicit relationships.

**Entity Types:**
- **People:** Names with credentials and roles
  - ❌ "An expert"
  - ✅ "Jane Smith, CMO with 15 years in SaaS marketing"

- **Places:** Specific locations, not vague regions
  - ❌ "The Texas area"
  - ✅ "Austin, Texas"

- **Things:** Specific products, tools, technologies
  - ❌ "A CRM system"
  - ✅ "Salesforce Sales Cloud Enterprise Edition"

- **Concepts:** Defined methodologies and frameworks
  - ❌ "Agile methods"
  - ✅ "Agile Scrum framework: iterative development in 2-week sprints"

**Why This Matters:**
AI platforms need clear entity relationships to understand content structure and cite appropriately.

**Implementation:**
- Define each entity on first mention
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Create explicit relationships between entities
- Include entity context (credentials, specifications, definitions)

### 2. Statistical Specificity
Replace vague claims with concrete, measurable data points.

**Transformation Examples:**

| ❌ Vague | ✅ Specific |
|---------|------------|
| "Significantly improved" | "Increased by 37% over 6 months" |
| "Fast processing" | "Processes 1,000 records in under 2 seconds" |
| "Affordable pricing" | "Starting at $49/month for teams up to 10 users" |
| "Many customers" | "Over 2,500 B2B companies in 47 countries" |
| "Recent study" | "Gartner 2024 Market Analysis (published May 2024)" |
| "High satisfaction" | "4.8/5 average rating from 1,200+ reviews" |

**Requirements:**
Every significant claim should include:
- A specific number or metric
- A timeframe or date
- A source or attribution (when citing research)

**Why This Matters:**
AI platforms prioritize content with verifiable, concrete information. Statistical specificity signals authority and reduces ambiguity.

### 3. Structured Content Architecture
AI platforms prefer content with clear, hierarchical information organization.

**Standard Template:**
```
1. Definition/Overview
   - What is this thing?
   - Core characteristics
   - Why it matters

2. Key Components/Features
   - What are the main elements?
   - How do they work?
   - What makes them distinct?

3. Use Cases/Applications
   - When is this used?
   - Who uses this?
   - Common scenarios

4. Comparisons
   - How does this relate to alternatives?
   - What are the tradeoffs?
   - Decision framework

5. Examples
   - Concrete instances
   - Case studies
   - Real-world applications

6. Common Questions (FAQ)
   - Direct answers to typical queries
   - Structured as Q&A
```

**Why This Matters:**
AI platforms extract information more effectively from well-structured content. Clear hierarchy = easier citation.

**Implementation:**
- Use descriptive headers (not vague like "More Info")
- Follow consistent information progression
- Include explicit transitions between sections
- Answer questions directly and early

---

### 4. Authority Signals
Elements that build credibility and citation-worthiness.

**Required Authority Elements:**

**Author Credentials:**
- Name, title, and relevant experience
- Affiliations or certifications
- Why they're qualified to write this

**Source Citations:**
- Link to original research and data
- Cite recognized industry sources
- Attribute statistics and claims
- Include publication dates

**Research/Data:**
- Reference reputable research firms (Gartner, Forrester, McKinsey, etc.)
- Include sample sizes and methodologies
- Show data provenance

**Case Studies:**
- Real company examples (with permission)
- Specific, measurable outcomes
- Before/after comparisons
- Timeline of results

**Expert Validation:**
- Quotes from recognized experts
- Third-party verification
- Industry recognition or awards

**Standard:** Minimum 3 authority signals per piece of content

**Why This Matters:**
AI platforms assess trustworthiness before citing. Strong authority signals increase citation probability.

## Content Scoring Rubric

Rate each piece of content on these dimensions (0-10 scale):

### Entity Optimization (0-10)
- 0-3: Entities poorly defined or absent
- 4-6: Entities present but inconsistently used
- 7-8: Entities clearly defined and consistent
- 9-10: Entities expertly woven with explicit relationships

### Statistical Specificity (0-10)
- 0-3: Mostly vague claims, few concrete metrics
- 4-6: Some data points, but many generalizations
- 7-8: Majority of claims backed by specific data
- 9-10: Every significant claim has concrete metrics

### Content Structure (0-10)
- 0-3: Poor organization, hard to follow
- 4-6: Basic structure, but gaps in flow
- 7-8: Clear hierarchy and logical progression
- 9-10: Perfectly structured for AI extraction

### Authority Signals (0-10)
- 0-3: Few or no credibility markers
- 4-6: Some authority signals present
- 7-8: Multiple strong authority elements
- 9-10: Exceptional credibility throughout

**Citation-Worthy Threshold:** 7+ on all four dimensions

## Application Guidelines

### For New Content:
1. Plan entity structure before writing
2. Research specific data points to include
3. Follow the standard template
4. Build in authority signals from the start
5. Review and score before publishing

### For Existing Content Optimization:
1. Audit against the 4 pillars
2. Identify lowest-scoring dimension
3. Add specific improvements:
   - Entities: Define and relate
   - Statistics: Add concrete data
   - Structure: Reorganize with template
   - Authority: Add citations and credentials
4. Re-score after improvements
5. Monitor citation changes

### For Citation Analysis:
1. Test content with relevant queries
2. Note when competitors are cited instead
3. Compare their content to ours using this framework
4. Identify specific gaps (which pillar scores lower?)
5. Prioritize improvements by impact

## Common Patterns for High Citation Rates

Based on analysis of frequently-cited content:

**✅ What Works:**
- Comparison tables with specific data
- "X vs Y" structured comparisons
- How-to guides with step-by-step structure
- Definitions with examples
- Statistics from recent, credible sources
- Content addressing "what is" and "how to" queries

**❌ What Doesn't Work:**
- Opinion pieces without data
- Vague, promotional content
- Outdated statistics (>2 years old)
- Thin content (<500 words on complex topics)
- Keyword-stuffed, unnatural writing
- Missing entity definitions

- Often cites content that directly answers common questions

### Perplexity:
- Prioritizes content with clear authority signals
- Values comparative analysis
- Often shows multiple sources, so differentiation matters

### Gemini:
- Strong preference for structured data
- Values entity clarity and relationships
