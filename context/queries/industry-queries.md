## Query Testing Protocol

When testing citation visibility:
1. Use exact queries as written (AI platforms are query-specific)
2. Test across all three platforms (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini)
3. Note position of citation (if present)
4. Record competitors who are cited
5. Assess context quality (positive, neutral, negative)
