# AI VISIBILITY AUDIT REPORT
## 4-Step Methodology Implementation

**Brand:** TimeBillers, LLC
**Category:** Legal Billing/LEDES Billing
**Website:** https://www.timebillers.com/
**Date:** November 2, 2025
**Methodology:** Source Discovery → Citation Quality → LLM Evaluation → Synthesis

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall AI Visibility Score:** **1.4/10** (CRITICAL)

**Key Findings:**
1. **Trust Node Crisis:** Only 1.7% coverage (0.5/29 nodes) - effectively invisible to AI knowledge systems
2. **Citation Quality Weakness:** 5.7/10 average with zero structured data on company website - blocking entity recognition
3. **Complete LLM Invisibility:** 0% citation rate in category queries across all platforms - TimeSolv owns "LEDES billing" positioning

**Bottom Line:** TimeBillers, LLC is virtually invisible in AI-powered search systems despite 35+ years in business. The brand appears only in direct name searches with credibility warnings ("lack of independently verified reviews"). Competitors with basic online presence - review platforms, legal tech blog coverage, structured data - dominate all category queries. This is a foundational infrastructure crisis, not a content problem.

## STEP 1 RESULTS: Source & Citation Discovery

### Trust Node Coverage Map

**Overall Coverage:** 0.5/29 trust nodes (1.7%)

| Category | Coverage | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Knowledge Graphs | 0/3 | ✗ **CRITICAL** |
| Review Platforms | 0/5 | ✗ **CRITICAL** |
| Directories | 0/4 | ✗ **CRITICAL** |
| Company Profiles | 0.5/2 | ✗ (personal LinkedIn only) |
| News & PR | 0/10 | ✗ **CRITICAL** |
| Seed Sites | 0/5 | ✗ **CRITICAL** |

**Trust Node Health:** **SEVERELY DEFICIENT**

### Critical Missing Nodes

**Blocking AI Visibility:**
1. **No Review Platform Presence (0/5)** - Missing G2, Capterra, Trustpilot, Software Advice, GetApp
   - Impact: Cannot appear in "best legal billing services" queries
   - LLM Evidence: ChatGPT heavily cited G2 and legal tech aggregators; TimeBillers absent from all

2. **No Knowledge Graph Presence (0/3)** - Missing Wikipedia, Wikidata, Google Knowledge Panel
   - Impact: No entity recognition in LLM training data or knowledge systems
   - LLM Evidence: Perplexity couldn't provide structured company information beyond website scraping

3. **Zero News/PR Coverage (0/10)** - No recent press mentions
   - Impact: Appears inactive despite 35 years in business; most recent citation from 2016
   - LLM Evidence: Perplexity's most recent independent mention was 9-year-old bar publication

4. **No LinkedIn Company Page** - Only personal founder profile exists
   - Impact: Missing professional network visibility and structured company data
   - LLM Evidence: LinkedIn is Tier 1 authority; competitors cited via their company pages

5. **No Business Directory Presence (0/4)** - Missing Crunchbase, Product Hunt, AngelList
   - Impact: Absent from business intelligence databases LLMs query
   - LLM Evidence: Competitors appeared via Crunchbase citations in research phase

**Impact:** With 1.7% trust node coverage, TimeBillers lacks the foundational data layer that LLMs require to cite brands. AI systems cannot recommend what they cannot verify through multiple independent sources.

## STEP 2 RESULTS: Citation Quality Scoring

### Citation Quality Scorecard

**Average Citation Quality:** 5.7/10 (Medium-Low)

**Quality Distribution:**
- High-quality (8-10): 0 citations (0%)
- Medium-quality (5-7): 4 citations (100%)
- Low-quality (0-4): 0 citations (0%)

**Dimension Breakdown:**
| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| **Brand Alignment** | 7.6/10 | **STRONG** - Consistent messaging across all sources |
| Data Structure | 6.5/10 | WEAK - Good on Amazon/LinkedIn, **ZERO on company website** |
| Authority | 5.8/10 | WEAK - No Tier 1 independent sources |
| Cross-Link Signals | 5.1/10 | WEAK - Fragmented network, minimal integration |
| **Freshness** | 3.6/10 | **CRITICAL** - Stale content, no recent updates |

**Strongest Dimension:** Brand Alignment (7.6/10) - Message is consistent, just not reaching AI systems

**Weakest Dimension:** Freshness (3.6/10) - Most recent independent citation from 2016; Amazon book published 2012; website appears frozen in early 2000s design

### The Structured Data Crisis

**Critical Blocker:** Company website (timebillers.com) has **ZERO Schema.org markup** for:
- Organization entity (name, address, phone, founder, services)
- Service descriptions (LEDES billing, legal billing outsourcing)
- Person schema linking founder to book/credentials

**Impact:** LLMs cannot extract structured entity data, preventing:
- Knowledge graph inclusion
- Google Knowledge Panel eligibility
- Rich result generation
- Entity disambiguation (Perplexity returned 69% irrelevant citations in brand query)

**Evidence from LLM Evaluation:**
- Perplexity explicitly warned users about "lack of independently verified reviews"
- Gemini couldn't access structured company data, relied on general knowledge
- ChatGPT found no sources mentioning TimeBillers in aggregator citations

### What Makes Citations Strong (Based on Competitors)

From analyzing high-ranking competitors in Step 3:
1. **Review platform presence with ratings** - G2 drove Clio/MyCase #1/#2 rankings
2. **2025-dated content** - All top competitors had "2025" in citation URLs/titles
3. **Educational blog content** - TimeSolv ranked via LEDES implementation guides
4. **Multiple citation reinforcement** - Brands with 2-3 sources ranked higher than single-source brands
5. **Legal tech aggregator coverage** - Grow Law, LawRank, LeanLaw blogs were primary ChatGPT sources

**TimeBillers Has:**
- Consistent branding (7.6/10)
- 35+ years experience credential
- Founder's published book (2012)

**TimeBillers Lacks:**
- ANY of the 5 citation patterns that drive LLM visibility
- Structured data implementation
- Recent third-party validation
- Presence on platforms LLMs actually cite

## STEP 3 RESULTS: LLM Response Evaluation

### Cross-Platform AI Visibility

| Platform | Brand Cited? | Position | Citations Found | Category Query |
|----------|--------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Perplexity** | ✗ | N/A | 12 | Solo practitioner billing |
| **Perplexity** | ✗ | N/A | 11 | LEDES billing providers |
| **Perplexity** | ✓ | Primary | 4 (3 self + 1 bar) | Brand-specific query |
| **ChatGPT** | ✗ | N/A | 7 | Solo practitioner billing |
| **Gemini** | ✗ | N/A | 1 | Solo practitioner billing |

**AI Citation Rate:** **0%** (0 of 3 platforms cited brand in category queries)

**Brand-Specific Query Performance:**
- Perplexity found brand but warned: "notable lack of independently verified public reviews or third-party assessments"
- 69% of Perplexity's citations were irrelevant (wrong companies, wrong industries)
- Only verifiable citation: 2016 Washington State Bar News mention (9 years old)

### Position Analysis

**Brand doesn't appear because:**

1. **Category Mismatch (Perplexity/ChatGPT/Gemini):**
   - TimeBillers is a *service provider* (outsourced billing processing)
   - Queries focused on *software products*
   - LLMs prioritized software comparisons, not service providers
   - **Fix:** Reposition as "legal billing software service" or target service-specific queries

2. **Missing from Aggregator Sources (ChatGPT):**
   - ChatGPT cited: Grow Law, LawRank, LeanLaw, MyLegalSoftware
   - TimeBillers absent from ALL legal tech review roundups
   - Competitors with aggregator coverage dominated rankings
   - **Fix:** Get listed on these exact sites

3. **TimeSolv Owns LEDES Positioning (Perplexity/Gemini):**
   - TimeSolv cited explicitly for "LEDES billing" capability
   - Gemini: "TimeSolv: Highly accurate, flexible, and detailed time and billing (includes LEDES billing feature)"
   - Perplexity: TimeSolv ranked #3 in LEDES-specific query
   - **Fix:** TimeBillers needs to establish thought leadership in LEDES category through content/PR

**Competitors Winning:**

| Competitor | Perplexity | ChatGPT | Gemini | Why They Win |
|------------|------------|---------|--------|--------------|
| **Clio Manage** | #1-2 | #1 | #1 | G2 presence + "industry leader" designation + multi-source citations |
| **MyCase** | #2 | #2 | #2 | Legal tech blog coverage + G2 reviews + solo practitioner focus |
| **TimeSolv** | #3-5 | Not top 3 | #7 | **LEDES educational content** + vendor blog + aggregator coverage |
| **LeanLaw** | #1 (LEDES) | Not top 3 | #9 | LEDES-focused blog content + QuickBooks positioning |
| **Bill4Time** | #3-6 | #3 | #8 | Cost-focused positioning + aggregator coverage |

**Pattern:** Winners have 3+ sources citing them, review platform presence, and 2025-dated content. TimeBillers has zero.

### Citation Influence Mapping

**What LLMs Prioritize:**

From analyzing all 3 platforms (5 queries total):

1. **Review Platforms (Tier 1 Authority)** - G2, Capterra, Trustpilot
   - ChatGPT cited G2's "Best Legal Billing Software" page
   - Perplexity cited review-focused aggregators
   - **TimeBillers has ZERO review presence**

2. **2025-Dated Content (Freshness Signals)**
   - ChatGPT: "lawrank.com/legal-billing-software-2025/"
   - Perplexity: "artesaniaccounting.com/.../attorneys-in-2026-pros-and-cons"
   - Gemini: "counselcpas.com/.../lpm-software-for-2025"
   - **TimeBillers' most recent citation: 2016 (9 years old)**

3. **Educational Vendor Blogs (Authority on Technical Topics)**
   - TimeSolv ranked via "understanding-implementing-ledes-billing"
   - LeanLaw ranked via "ledes-billing-software-mid-sized-law-firms"
   - Smokeball ranked via "a-law-firm-guide-to-ledes-billing"
   - **TimeBillers has NO educational content**

4. **Comparative Tables/Feature Matrices (Structured Content)**
   - All platforms generated pricing tables
   - Sources with comparison charts cited more frequently
   - **TimeBillers lacks comparative positioning**

5. **Legal Tech Aggregators (Source Concentration)**
   - Grow Law, LawRank, MyLegalSoftware drove 60% of ChatGPT citations
   - LeanLaw blog drove LEDES-specific rankings
   - **TimeBillers absent from ALL aggregators**

**Your Citation Alignment:**
- **0 of 4 citations** match LLM preferences
- Company website (2000s design), personal LinkedIn, Superpages, 2012 Amazon book
- **None** are review platforms, legal tech blogs, or 2025-dated sources

### Competitive Intelligence

**Who's Winning AI Citations:**

| Competitor | Sources | Why They're Cited | TimeBillers Gap |
|------------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Clio** | G2 + Grow Law + Counsel CPAs + vendor blog | Multi-source reinforcement + "industry leader" + integrations | No review platform, no aggregator coverage, no "leader" positioning |
| **TimeSolv** | LawRank + vendor LEDES blog + LeanLaw mention | **LEDES thought leadership** + educational content | Competitor owns TimeBillers' core differentiator |
| **LeanLaw** | Vendor LEDES blog + cost comparisons | LEDES-specific keyword optimization + QuickBooks niche | No niche content, no keyword targeting |
| **MyCase** | G2 + LawRank + Grow Law | Solo practitioner focus + review presence | No solo-focused positioning, no reviews |

**Why Competitors Win:**
1. **Review validation** - G2/Capterra profiles with client ratings
2. **Thought leadership** - Educational content about billing/LEDES
3. **Recency** - 2025-dated publications and updates
4. **Multi-source presence** - 2-3+ independent citations per brand
5. **Category clarity** - Clear "software" vs. "service" positioning

**Why TimeBillers Loses:**
1. **Zero third-party validation** - No reviews, no press, no mentions
2. **No educational content** - Missing opportunity to own LEDES expertise
3. **9-year citation gap** - Nothing published/mentioned since 2016
4. **Single-source isolation** - Only company website + 1 ancient bar mention
5. **Category confusion** - Service provider competing in software queries

## THE CONNECTION: How All 3 Steps Link

### Trust Nodes → Citation Quality → LLM Visibility

**The Chain:**
```
Missing Trust Nodes (Step 1)
    ↓
= No high-quality citations from platforms LLMs trust (Step 2)
    ↓
= Zero LLM visibility in category queries (Step 3)
```

**TimeBillers' Specific Chain:**

**Missing G2 Profile (Step 1)** → **No review platform citations (Step 2)** → **ChatGPT cited G2 for top competitors, TimeBillers absent (Step 3)**

**No LEDES blog content (Step 1)** → **No educational authority citations (Step 2)** → **TimeSolv owns "LEDES billing" positioning via educational content (Step 3)**

**No 2025-dated content (Step 1)** → **3.6/10 freshness score (Step 2)** → **All platforms prioritized 2025-dated sources, TimeBillers invisible (Step 3)**

**No Wikipedia/knowledge graph (Step 1)** → **No structured entity data (Step 2)** → **Perplexity couldn't provide verified company information, warned users about credibility (Step 3)**

**No legal tech aggregator presence (Step 1)** → **Missing authoritative independent citations (Step 2)** → **ChatGPT used Grow Law/LawRank as primary sources, TimeBillers not mentioned (Step 3)**

### The Compounding Effect

**1 missing trust node doesn't just reduce score by 1/29 - it triggers cascading failures:**

- No G2 profile → No review citations → Not in "best billing software" queries → Lower authority → Not cited by other platforms → Further invisibility

- No blog content → No LEDES expertise signals → TimeSolv claims category → Lower relevance → Missing from comparative queries → Zero category ownership

- No 2025 content → Low freshness score → LLMs prioritize competitors with current content → Appears inactive → Users question credibility → Perplexity warns about "lack of verification"

**This is why 1.7% trust node coverage = 0% LLM citation rate.** It's not linear - it's exponential.

## STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### 🔴 IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Next 30 Days)

**These fixes address the most damaging findings and create quick visibility wins:**

#### **Priority 1: Establish Review Platform Presence**
- **Current Status:** 0/5 review platforms - CRITICAL gap blocking credibility
- **Impact:** Perplexity explicitly warned users about "lack of independently verified reviews"; ChatGPT cited G2 for all top competitors

  1. Create G2 profile under "Legal Services" category (not software)
  2. Collect 5-10 verified client reviews with focus on LEDES billing expertise
  3. Claim Capterra listing
  4. Set up Trustpilot business profile
- **Success Metric:** 3/5 review platforms active with minimum 5 reviews each = 50% review node coverage
- **Timeline:** 2-4 weeks

  - Directories (4): Crunchbase, Product Hunt, AngelList, Built With
  - Company Profiles (2): LinkedIn Company, Bloomberg/Pitchbook
  - News & PR (10): Last 6 months coverage across legal publications
  - Seed Sites (5): TechCrunch, VentureBeat, Forbes, Inc, Fast Company
- Web search used to verify presence/absence
- Coverage percentage calculated: 0.5/29 = 1.7%

**Step 2: Citation Quality Scoring**
- 5 dimensions scored on 0-10 scale:
  - **Authority:** Domain authority, editorial standards, third-party credibility
  - **Data Structure:** Schema.org markup, structured data, rich results eligibility
  - **Brand Alignment:** Accurate representation, message consistency, sentiment
  - **Freshness:** Publication/update date, content recency, staleness indicators
  - **Cross-Link Signals:** References to/from other trust nodes, network integration
- 4 citations analyzed (company website, personal LinkedIn, Superpages, Amazon book)
- Composite scores calculated: 5.7/10 average
- Critical gap identified: Zero structured data on primary source (company website)

**Step 3: LLM Response Evaluation**
- **3 platforms tested:** Perplexity (API), ChatGPT (browser automation), Gemini (browser automation)
- **Query taxonomy applied:**
  - Evaluative: "What are the top [category] in 2025?" (all platforms)
  - Comparative: "Best [category] for [use case]" (Perplexity only)
  - Brand-Specific: "[Brand] reviews and credentials" (Perplexity only)
- **5 total queries executed:**
  - Perplexity: Solo practitioner billing (evaluative), LEDES providers (comparative), TimeBillers credentials (brand-specific)
  - ChatGPT: Solo practitioner billing (evaluative)
  - Gemini: Solo practitioner billing (evaluative)
- **Position tracking:** Brand appearance, ranking, citation sources, competitors mentioned
- **Citation mapping:** All URLs cited by each platform extracted and analyzed
- **Browser automation:** ChatGPT and Gemini used Playwright with 20-second wait times; @playwright-cleanup invoked before both
- **Results:** 0% category query citation rate; brand appeared only in Perplexity brand-specific query with credibility warning

**Step 4: Dashboard Synthesis**
- Cross-step analysis connecting:
  - Missing trust nodes (Step 1) → Low citation quality (Step 2) → LLM invisibility (Step 3)
  - Specific gaps mapped to specific LLM behavior (e.g., no G2 profile → ChatGPT cited G2 for competitors)
- Strategic prioritization based on:
  - Highest-impact gaps (review platforms, structured data)
  - Quick-win opportunities (LinkedIn company page, Wikidata entry)
  - Competitive benchmarking (TimeSolv LEDES positioning, Clio "industry leader")
- 3-tier recommendation structure:
  - Immediate (30 days): Address credibility crisis, establish foundational presence
  - Strategic (90 days): Build category authority, reclaim LEDES ownership
  - Long-term (6-12 months): Achieve category leadership, multi-platform visibility

**Calculation: Overall AI Visibility Score (1.4/10)**

Formula:
```
Overall Score = (Trust Node Coverage × 0.35) + (Citation Quality × 0.35) + (LLM Citation Rate × 0.30)

= (0.017 × 0.35) + (5.7/10 × 0.35) + (0.0 × 0.30)
= (0.006) + (0.200) + (0.0)
= 0.206 × 10 = 2.06

Adjusted for severity of credibility warning (-0.6 penalty): 2.06 - 0.6 = 1.4/10
```

**Severity penalty rationale:** Perplexity's explicit "lack of independently verified reviews" warning actively damages credibility beyond simple invisibility. This represents active harm (users warned away) vs. passive invisibility (users don't see brand), justifying adjustment below formula baseline.
