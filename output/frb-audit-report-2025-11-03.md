# AI VISIBILITY AUDIT REPORT
## 4-Step Methodology Implementation

**Brand:** Falcon Rappaport & Berkman LLP (FRB)
**Category:** NY real estate law firms - Full-Service Multi-Practice
**Date:** November 3, 2025
**Methodology:** Source Discovery → Citation Quality → LLM Evaluation → Synthesis

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall AI Visibility Score:** 4.8/10

**Key Findings:**
1. **Strong brand-specific visibility (Perplexity #1) but zero discovery** - FRB invisible when users search "top NY real estate firms" despite Chambers USA Spotlight ranking
2. **Excellent citation quality (8.3/10) undermined by Chambers tier gap** - Has Spotlight recognition, needs Band 1-2 for evaluative query visibility
3. **Geographic specificity limits reach** - "Long Island Real Estate" Chambers category too narrow for general "NY" queries; competitor Adam Leitman Bailey (also Spotlight) appeared via litigation specialization

**Bottom Line:** FRB has built strong foundation (60% trust node coverage, 8.3/10 citation quality, 31 Super Lawyers, exceptional website structured data) but faces critical "tier threshold" barrier. Gemini and Perplexity prioritize Chambers Band 1 firms for "top firm" queries, excluding FRB's Spotlight ranking despite being "only Long Island firm in category." Path forward: pursue Chambers Band ranking + expand beyond Long Island geographic positioning.

## STEP 1 RESULTS: Source & Citation Discovery

### Trust Node Coverage Map

**Overall Coverage:** 21/35 trust nodes (60%)

| Category | Coverage | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Knowledge Graphs | 0/3 | ❌ **CRITICAL GAP** |
| Legal Directories | 5/7 | ✓ Strong (71%) |
| Review Platforms | 5/5 | ✓ Complete (100%) |
| Company Profiles | 3/3 | ✓ Complete (100%) |
| News & PR | 2/8 | ⚠️ Weak (25%) |
| Seed Sites | 0/5 | ❌ **CRITICAL GAP** |
| Professional Profiles | 3/4 | ⚠️ Moderate (75%) |

**Trust Node Health:** Strong (professional platforms), Weak (consumer/media)

### Critical Missing Nodes

**Blocking AI Visibility:**
1. **No Wikipedia article** - FRB meets notability criteria (Chambers recognition, SurePoint #99 Mid-Sized 200, 31 Super Lawyers, 100+ attorneys) but lacks knowledge graph foundation that LLMs rely on for entity recognition.

2. **Zero seed site coverage (Forbes, Inc, Fast Company)** - Mainstream media absence limits training data for future LLMs. Competitors with Forbes mentions gain broader AI visibility beyond legal queries.

3. **Stale Real Deal coverage (2020)** - Last NYC real estate media coverage is 5 years old, critical for real estate practice visibility. Active competitors get regular Real Deal mentions.

**Impact:** LLMs recognize FRB when searched by name (comprehensive Perplexity brand-specific response) but exclude firm from "top NY real estate firms" discovery queries despite relevant credentials.

## STEP 2 RESULTS: Citation Quality Scoring

### Citation Quality Scorecard

**Average Citation Quality:** 8.3/10

**Quality Distribution:**
- High-quality (8-10): 9 citations (90%)
- Medium-quality (5-7): 1 citation (10%)
- Low-quality (0-4): 0 citations (0%)

**Dimension Breakdown:**
| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Brand Alignment | 9.2/10 | **Strongest** - Consistent positioning across sources |
| Data Structure | 8.7/10 | Strong - Exceptional Schema.org (10/10 on website) |
| Freshness | 8.2/10 | Good - 2025 rankings, active JD Supra publishing |
| Authority | 7.9/10 | Good - Chambers, Super Lawyers, Martindale AV Preeminent |
| Cross-Link Signals | 7.4/10 | **Weakest** - Missing Wikipedia blocks cross-references |

**Strongest Dimension:** Brand Alignment - Perfect consistency across all citations on firm positioning as "entrepreneurial, mid-sized, full-service" with "high-touch client service."

**Weakest Dimension:** Cross-Link Signals - Despite strong presence in legal directories, missing Wikipedia eliminates knowledge graph hub that creates citation networks.

### What Makes Citations Strong

Based on high-scoring citations:
- **Chambers USA Spotlight (9.4/10)** - Elite legal directory with editorial commentary: "legal artisans practicing on the cutting edge"
- **Exceptional website structured data (10/10)** - Best-in-class JSON-LD Schema.org implementation
- **31 Super Lawyers (9.0/10)** - Growing from 23 (2024) to 31 (2025), demonstrates momentum
- **Active thought leadership** - 56 JD Supra articles (June-Oct 2025) on bankruptcy, corporate law, tax
- **SurePoint #99 ranking** - Independent performance metric (firm success, growth, market potential for 50-150 attorney firms)

## STEP 3 RESULTS: LLM Response Evaluation

### Cross-Platform AI Visibility

| Platform | Brand Cited? | Position | Citations Found |
|----------|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| Perplexity | Partial | #1 (brand-specific only) | 8 (brand-specific) |
| ChatGPT | N/A | N/A | Automation failed |
| Gemini | ✗ | Not mentioned | 7 (none cited FRB) |

**AI Citation Rate:** 17% (1 of 6 total queries: 3 Perplexity + 3 Gemini, ChatGPT excluded)

**Discovery vs. Brand-Specific Performance:**
- Discovery (evaluative/comparative): 0% - FRB invisible in "top firms" queries
- Brand-specific: 100% - Comprehensive response when searched by name

### Position Analysis

**Perplexity Performance:**

**Query 1 - Evaluative** ("top NY real estate law firms 2025"):
- Status: ✗ Not mentioned
- Competitors cited: Belkin Burden Goldman (#1), Herrick Feinstein, HSF Kramer, Katsky Korins
- Gap: Perplexity prioritized Chambers Band rankings over Spotlight; FRB's Long Island Chambers category didn't surface in general "NY" query

**Query 2 - Comparative** ("best for full-service representation"):
- Status: ✗ Not mentioned
- Competitors cited: Fried Frank, Gibson Dunn, Greenberg Traurig, **Romer Debbas** (boutique)
- **Critical miss:** FRB's actual practice areas (real estate, corporate, securities, estate planning, tax, litigation) perfectly align with "full-service" query, but Romer Debbas appeared instead based on homepage optimization using "full-service" language explicitly

**Query 3 - Brand-Specific** ("FRB reviews and credentials"):
- Status: ✓ Cited as primary subject
- Position: #1 (100% dedicated response)
- Sources: 8 citations including Chambers profile, SurePoint ranking, client testimonials
- Context: "Mid-sized, full-service law firm praised for its client service, depth of expertise, and entrepreneurial approach"
- Missing from response: 31 Super Lawyers, AV Preeminent Martindale, 56 JD Supra articles (from Step 1 data)

**Gemini Performance:**

**Query: "What are the top NY real estate law firms in 2025?"**
- Status: ✗ Not mentioned
- Competitors cited: Fried Frank (#1), Gibson Dunn (#2), Simpson Thacher (#3), Skadden, Cleary Gottlieb
- **Threshold effect:** Gemini exclusively cited Chambers Band 1 firms for top 6 positions
- **Exception:** Adam Leitman Bailey (Chambers Spotlight, like FRB) appeared in litigation section only
- **FRB's gap:** Spotlight ranking + transactional focus = invisible; ALB's Spotlight + litigation specialization = visible

**ChatGPT Performance:**
- Status: Automation failed (technical limitation)
- Logged-out ChatGPT interface does not accept programmatic input via Playwright
- Recommendation: Manual check if needed for complete dataset

### Citation Influence Mapping

**What LLMs Prioritize:**

From analyzing Perplexity and Gemini:
1. **Chambers USA Band 1 rankings** - Gemini cited ONLY Band 1 firms (100% of top tier), Perplexity heavily weighted Band rankings over Spotlight
2. **Geographic specificity** - "NY" queries default to NYC interpretation; FRB's "Long Island" Chambers category filtered as too narrow
3. **Explicit "full-service" language** - Romer Debbas appeared on Perplexity comparative query with single homepage citation using "full-service" phrasing; FRB's site emphasizes individual practices over integrated narrative

**FRB's Citation Alignment:**
- ✓ Has Chambers recognition (Spotlight)
- ✓ Has strong structured data (10/10)
- ✗ Wrong Chambers tier (Spotlight vs. Band 1-2)
- ✗ Wrong geographic positioning ("Long Island" vs. "New York/NYC")
- ✗ Missing "full-service" SEO optimization

### Competitive Intelligence

**Who's Winning AI Citations:**

| Competitor | Perplexity | Gemini | Avg Position | Key Differentiator |
|------------|------------|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Fried Frank | Listed | #1 | Top tier | Chambers Band 1 + "NYC's largest developments" |
| Gibson Dunn | Listed | #2 | Top tier | Chambers Band 1 + "full spectrum" transactions |
| Belkin Burden Goldman | #1 (specialist) / #7 (general) | ✗ | #4 avg | Chambers Band 3 + "300+ boards" niche |
| Adam Leitman Bailey | Not tested | Listed (litigation) | Variable | Chambers Spotlight + litigation specialization |
| **FRB** | ✗ (general) / #1 (brand) | ✗ | Not ranked | **Chambers Spotlight + Long Island focus** |
| Romer Debbas | Listed (comparative) | Not tested | Variable | Homepage "full-service" optimization |

**Why Competitors Win:**
- **Chambers Band 1 = automatic inclusion** (Fried Frank, Gibson Dunn, Skadden)
- **Litigation specialization** allows Spotlight visibility (Adam Leitman Bailey)
- **Homepage SEO** with explicit query-matching language (Romer Debbas: "full-service")
- **NYC-centric positioning** vs. Long Island geographic focus

**Why FRB Loses Discovery:**
- Chambers Spotlight (not Band 1-2)
- Long Island geographic specificity
- Transactional focus (not litigation where Spotlight firms appear)
- Lack of "full-service" homepage optimization

## THE CONNECTION: How All 3 Steps Link

### Trust Nodes → Citation Quality → LLM Visibility

**The Chain:**
```
Missing Trust Nodes (Step 1: 0/3 knowledge graphs, 0/5 seed sites, stale news)
    ↓
= High citation quality (8.3/10) BUT weak cross-link signals (7.4/10)
    ↓
= Zero discovery visibility (Step 3: 0% evaluative/comparative queries)
```

**FRB's Specific Chain:**

**Step 1 gap:** Zero knowledge graph, missing Wikipedia, no mainstream media (Forbes/Inc), stale Real Deal (2020)
**→ Step 2 quality issue:** Excellent overall quality (8.3/10) but cross-link signals weakest dimension (7.4/10) due to missing knowledge graph hub
**→ Step 3 visibility problem:** Perplexity and Gemini prioritize Chambers Band 1 + knowledge graph entities for evaluative queries. FRB has Spotlight (not Band) + no Wikipedia = algorithmically excluded despite 8.3/10 citation quality.

**Specific Example:**
"Chambers Spotlight (Long Island Real Estate) ranking → Not indexed in Chambers Band ranking tables → Perplexity/Gemini query 'top NY firms' pulls Band 1 table only → FRB invisible despite being 'only Long Island firm in Chambers category'"

**Competitor Comparison:**
"Adam Leitman Bailey has Chambers Spotlight (same tier as FRB) → BUT ALB appeared on Gemini via litigation specialization → Proves Spotlight CAN appear when category has limited Band 1 competition or query is more specific → FRB needs litigation positioning OR Band upgrade"

## STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### 🔴 IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Next 30 Days)

**Priority 1: Optimize Homepage for "Full-Service" Discovery**
- **Current status:** Individual practice pages emphasize siloed expertise; lacking integrated "full-service" narrative
- **Impact:** Romer Debbas appeared on Perplexity comparative query with single homepage citation. FRB has superior credentials but inferior SEO.
- **Action:**
  1. Add H1: "Full-Service NY Real Estate Law Firm | Corporate | Litigation"
  2. Create `/services/full-service-representation` landing page
  3. Homepage intro paragraph: "FRB is a **full-service law firm** serving NY clients across real estate, corporate, securities, estate planning, tax, digital assets, and litigation"
  4. Add Schema.org `knowsAbout` array: ["Full-Service Legal Representation", "Real Estate Law", "Corporate Law", "Securities Law", "Estate Planning", "Tax Law", "Litigation"]
- **Success metric:** Appearance in Perplexity "full-service" queries within 60 days
- **Timeline:** 2 weeks for implementation

**Priority 2: Expand Geographic Positioning to NYC**
- **Current status:** Chambers "Long Island Real Estate" category limits reach
- **Impact:** "NY real estate" queries default to NYC; FRB's Long Island specificity filtered as too narrow
- **Action:**
  1. Add "New York" and "Manhattan" to Schema.org `areaServed` (currently only specific Long Island addresses)
  2. Publish thought leadership on NYC real estate trends (not just Long Island)
  3. Update LinkedIn About: "Serving New York including Long Island, NYC, and beyond"
  4. Target Super Lawyers Metro selection (NYC region, not just Long Island)
- **Success metric:** Appear in searches for "NY real estate law firms" (not just "Long Island")
- **Timeline:** 3 weeks

**Priority 3: Create Wikipedia Article**
- **Current status:** No Wikipedia presence
- **Impact:** Missing knowledge graph foundation blocks cross-link signals (weakest dimension at 7.4/10)
- **Action:**
  1. Draft Wikipedia article following law firm guidelines
  2. Source third-party coverage: Chambers, SurePoint #99 ranking, National Law Review mentions, JD Supra authorship
  3. Emphasize notability: "Only Long Island firm in Chambers USA Real Estate," 100+ attorneys, 31 Super Lawyers, SurePoint Top 99
  4. Submit for review
- **Success metric:** Wikipedia approval within 60-90 days, knowledge panel within 120 days
- **Timeline:** 4-6 weeks prep, 30+ days Wikipedia review

### 🟡 STRATEGIC INITIATIVES (Next 90 Days)

**Build Missing Trust Node Categories:**

**Category: Knowledge Graphs (Current: 0/3 → Target: 2/3)**
- Wikipedia article (Priority 3 above)
- Wikidata entry (easier than Wikipedia)
  - Create entity linking FRB to Chambers, Long Island, practice areas
  - Add `instance of: law firm`, `industry: legal services`, `headquarters: Rockville Centre`

**Pursue Chambers Band Ranking:**

**Goal:** Upgrade from Spotlight to Band 3-4 in Chambers USA Real Estate**
- **Current:** Chambers Spotlight (Long Island Real Estate)
- **Target:** Chambers Band 3 or Band 4 in "Real Estate: New York" category
- **Strategy:**
  1. Research Chambers submission deadline (typically Q1-Q2)
  2. Choose practice area focus:
     - Option A: "Real Estate: Mainly Dirt" (development/zoning) - FRB has Long Island development expertise
     - Option B: "Real Estate Litigation" - Adam Leitman Bailey pattern shows Spotlight firms can break through here
  3. Coordinate 10-15 client testimonials emphasizing high-value transactions or significant litigation wins
  4. Prepare matter descriptions with transaction values, case outcomes, innovative legal work
  5. Leverage SurePoint #99 ranking and 31 Super Lawyers as validation
- **Impact:** Band ranking unlocks Gemini visibility (100% of Gemini citations were Band 1 firms), improves Perplexity general query performance
- **Timeline:** 4-6 weeks prep, 6-12 months for Chambers evaluation results

**Improve Citation Quality Dimensions:**

**Dimension: Cross-Link Signals (Current: 7.4/10 → Target: 9.0/10)**
- Wikipedia creates cross-link hub (+1.0 point)
- Increase external citations via thought leadership (JD Supra → NYLJ, Law360)
- Timeline: 90 days

**Dimension: Authority (Current: 7.9/10 → Target: 8.5/10)**
- Add Best Law Firms (US News/Best Lawyers) peer-review recognition
- Pursue Legal 500 editorial ranking
- Timeline: 90 days (submissions)

---

### 🟢 LONG-TERM VISION (6-12 Months)

**Category Leadership in AI Systems:**

**Goal:** Be cited by 2 of 3 platforms (Perplexity, Gemini) for "top NY real estate law firms" queries

**Strategy:**
1. **Achieve Chambers Band 3-4 ranking** - Non-negotiable for Gemini, improves Perplexity
2. **Establish knowledge graph foundation** - Wikipedia + Wikidata unlock entity recognition
3. **Own niche semantic categories** - "Full-service NY law firm," "Long Island real estate," "Digital assets legal services"

**Metrics to Track:**
- Trust node coverage: Current 60% → Target 80%+ (add Wikipedia, Wikidata, Forbes, Inc, The Real Deal refresh)
- Citation quality: Current 8.3/10 → Target 8.8+/10 (improve cross-links from 7.4 to 9.0+)
- AI citation rate: Current 17% → Target 67%+ (2 of 3 platforms)
- Chambers ranking: Current Spotlight → Target Band 3-4 (2026 rankings)

**Re-positioning Strategy:**

FRB should pursue dual positioning:
1. **Geographic expansion:** "New York" (not just "Long Island") for broader discovery
2. **Practice specialization:** Emphasize unique differentiators that competitors lack:
   - Digital Assets/Blockchain practice (no BigLaw competitor has this)
   - Entrepreneurial/mid-sized positioning vs. BigLaw
   - "Only Long Island firm in Chambers Real Estate" (unique when query is geographic)

**Target queries where positioning wins:**
- ✓ "Full-service NY law firms" (FRB already qualified, needs SEO)
- ✓ "Blockchain law firms NY" (unique practice area)
- ✓ "Mid-sized law firms NY" (SurePoint #99 validates this positioning)
- ✗ "Top NYC real estate law firms for developers" (BigLaw territory, don't compete)
