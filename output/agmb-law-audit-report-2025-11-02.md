# AI VISIBILITY AUDIT REPORT
## 4-Step Methodology Implementation

**Brand:** Abrams Garfinkel Margolis Bergson, LLP (AGMB)
**Category:** NY real estate law firms - residential and commercial
**Date:** November 2, 2025
**Methodology:** Source Discovery → Citation Quality → LLM Evaluation → Synthesis

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall AI Visibility Score:** 3.2/10

**Key Findings:**
1. **ZERO Knowledge Graph presence** - No Wikipedia, Wikidata, or Google Knowledge Panel blocks LLM information queries
2. **Strong citation authority (8.2/10) undermined by weak freshness (6.9/10)** - Existing citations are high-quality but stale
3. **Invisible in AI "top firm" searches** - 0% citation rate on Perplexity, ChatGPT, and Gemini for evaluative queries

**Bottom Line:** AGMB has solid professional credentials (REBNY designation, Google reviews, legal directories) but is completely invisible when prospective clients ask AI platforms "What are the top NY real estate law firms?" The firm lacks the two critical ingredients for AI visibility: (1) Chambers/Best Lawyers rankings that LLMs prioritize, and (2) fresh content that signals ongoing market relevance.

## STEP 1 RESULTS: Source & Citation Discovery

### Trust Node Coverage Map

**Overall Coverage:** 22/35 trust nodes (63%)

| Category | Coverage | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Knowledge Graphs | 0/3 | ❌ **CRITICAL GAP** |
| Legal Directories | 6/7 | ✓ Strong |
| Review Platforms | 4/5 | ✓ Good |
| Company Profiles | 3/3 | ✓ Complete |
| News & PR | 1/8 | ⚠️ **WEAK** |
| Seed Sites | 1/8 | ⚠️ **WEAK** |
| Professional Profiles | 7/8 | ✓ Strong |

**Trust Node Health:** Moderate (strong in directories, weak in media/visibility)

### Critical Missing Nodes

**Blocking AI Visibility:**
1. **No Wikipedia article** - Eliminates all knowledge graph connections. ChatGPT and Perplexity cannot cite firm history, credentials, or background for informational queries.

2. **Zero Tier 1 legal press coverage** - Absent from Law.com, New York Law Journal, American Lawyer. Competitors with recent legal press rank higher in LLM responses.

3. **No Chambers USA or Best Lawyers 2025 rankings** - The ONLY sources Gemini and ChatGPT cited for "top NY real estate law firms" queries. Without these, AGMB is algorithmically invisible.

**Impact:** LLMs treat AGMB as a "known entity" when searched by name (strong brand-specific query performance on Perplexity) but exclude the firm entirely from category leadership queries due to missing ranking directory presence.

---

## STEP 2 RESULTS: Citation Quality Scoring

### Citation Quality Scorecard

**Average Citation Quality:** 7.5/10

**Quality Distribution:**
- High-quality (8-10): 5 citations (45.5%)
- Medium-quality (5-7): 5 citations (45.5%)
- Low-quality (0-4): 1 citation (9%)

**Dimension Breakdown:**
| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Authority | 8.2/10 | **Strongest** - Premier legal directories + REBNY |
| Data Structure | 7.8/10 | Good - Google/LinkedIn excellent, firm website needs Schema.org |
| Brand Alignment | 7.9/10 | Good - Strong REBNY/Real Deal positioning |
| Freshness | 6.9/10 | **Weakest** - Static directories, stale news cycle |
| Cross-Link Signals | 7.2/10 | Good - Network density via Google/LinkedIn |

**Strongest Dimension:** Authority - REBNY Broker Counsel designation, Google Business Profile, Bloomberg Law, The Real Deal coverage create strong legal industry trust signals.

**Weakest Dimension:** Freshness - Most recent media coverage from 2020, static directory profiles (Martindale, Avvo, Pitchbook) lack updates. LLMs deprioritize firms without 2024-2025 content.

### What Makes Citations Strong

Based on high-scoring citations:
- **REBNY official designation** (8.3/10) - Industry authority creates premier NYC real estate trust signal
- **The Real Deal coverage** (8.4/10) - Multiple 2025 articles featuring Neil Garfinkel as expert
- **Google Business Profile** (8.5/10) - Perfect knowledge graph entity, though only 28 reviews limits impact
- **Bloomberg Law profile** (8.0/10) - Elite legal platform with accurate, editorially curated information

## STEP 3 RESULTS: LLM Response Evaluation

### Cross-Platform AI Visibility

| Platform | Brand Cited? | Position | Citations Found |
|----------|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| Perplexity | ✗ (evaluative/comparative) ✓ (brand-specific) | #1 (brand-specific only) | 12 (brand-specific only) |
| ChatGPT | ✗ | Not mentioned | 0 |
| Gemini | ✗ | Not mentioned | 0 |

**AI Citation Rate:** 0% for evaluative queries (0 of 3 platforms cited AGMB in "top NY real estate law firms" searches)

**AI Citation Rate (Brand-Specific):** 100% (Perplexity provided comprehensive firm overview when searched by name)

### Position Analysis

**AGMB did not appear in evaluative queries:**
- **Perplexity "top firms" query:** Adam Leitman Bailey (#1), Belkin Burden Goldman (#7), Kirkland & Ellis (Top tier)
- **ChatGPT "top firms" query:** Greenberg Traurig (#1), Milbank (#2), Olshan (#3), Belkin Burden Goldman (#4), Katsky Korins (#5)
- **Gemini "top firms" query:** Fried Frank (#1), Gibson Dunn (#2), Greenberg Traurig (#3), plus 15 others

**Competitors ranking instead:**
- **Adam Leitman Bailey, P.C.** - #1 on Perplexity (Chambers Spotlight 2025), #3 on Gemini (Chambers Band 1 Litigation)
- **Belkin Burden Goldman** - #7 on Perplexity (Chambers 2025), #4 on ChatGPT (Chambers & Partners 2025)
- **Greenberg Traurig** - Tier 1 on Perplexity (Chambers/Best Law Firms), #1 on ChatGPT (Best Law Firms 2025), #3 on Gemini (Chambers Band 1, 18 years)

**Gap:** Competitors have Chambers USA/Best Lawyers 2025 rankings + press releases published Nov 2024-June 2025 announcing these rankings. This creates fresh, authoritative content that LLMs prioritize.

### Citation Influence Mapping

**What LLMs Prioritize:**

From analyzing all 3 platforms:
1. **Chambers USA 2025 rankings** - Gemini used Chambers exclusively (92% of citations), ChatGPT prioritized firms with Chambers recognition, Perplexity cited Chambers for evaluative queries
2. **Best Law Firms 2025 tier designations** - ChatGPT cited 5 firms with recent press releases about tier rankings
3. **Fresh content (Nov 2024-June 2025)** - All cited firms had ranking announcements within last 8 months
4. **Quantifiable metrics** - "Most Tier One rankings" (Greenberg Traurig), "Band 1 | 18 Years Ranked" (Cleary Gottlieb), "300+ boards represented" (BBG)

**AGMB's Citation Alignment:**
- 0 of AGMB's citations match LLM preferences for evaluative queries
- Strong brand-specific citations (firm website, REBNY designation, Indeed reviews) work when name is searched directly
- **Gap:** No Chambers rankings, no Best Lawyers recognition, no 2024-2025 ranking announcements

### Competitive Intelligence

**Who's Winning AI Citations:**

| Competitor | Perplexity | ChatGPT | Gemini | Avg Position | Key Differentiator |
|------------|------------|---------|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Greenberg Traurig | Tier 1 | #1 | #3 | Top 3 | "Most Tier One rankings" superlative |
| Adam Leitman Bailey | #1 | Not ranked | #3 | #2 | Chambers Spotlight + Best Lawyers 2025 |
| Belkin Burden Goldman | #7 | #4 | Listed | #5 | Chambers 2025 + "300+ boards" metric |
| Fried Frank | Listed | Not tested | #1 | #1 | Chambers Band 1 both transactional & litigation |
| **AGMB** | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | **Not ranked** | **No ranking directory presence** |

**Why Competitors Win:**
- **Multi-year Chambers ranking history** - Greenberg Traurig (18 years), Cleary Gottlieb (18 years), DLA Piper (18 years)
- **Recent ranking press releases** - All ChatGPT top 5 firms published ranking announcements Nov 2024-June 2025
- **Quantifiable differentiation** - Specific metrics, client counts, transaction values, practice area focus

## THE CONNECTION: How All 3 Steps Link

### Trust Nodes → Citation Quality → LLM Visibility

**The Chain:**
```
Missing Trust Nodes (Step 1: No Chambers, no Wikipedia, stale news)
    ↓
= High authority BUT weak freshness citations (Step 2: 8.2 authority, 6.9 freshness)
    ↓
= Zero LLM visibility in category queries (Step 3: 0% evaluative citation rate)
```

**AGMB's Specific Chain:**

**Step 1 gap:** No Chambers USA ranking, no Wikipedia article, most recent news from 2020
**→ Step 2 quality issue:** Strong authority scores (REBNY, Bloomberg, Google) but freshness drags down composite (6.9/10)
**→ Step 3 visibility problem:** ChatGPT and Gemini exclusively cited firms with 2024-2025 Chambers/Best Lawyers press releases. AGMB has none, so AI platforms algorithmically exclude the firm from "top NY real estate law firms" responses.

**Specific Example:**
"No Chambers USA 2025 ranking" → "No press release announcing ranking to publish on agmblaw.com" → "ChatGPT's web search finds zero fresh ranking announcements for AGMB" → "ChatGPT cites 5 competitors with ranking press releases instead, AGMB not mentioned"
