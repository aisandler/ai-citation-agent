# AI VISIBILITY AUDIT REPORT
## 4-Step Methodology Implementation

**Brand:** hydr8
**Category:** office facilities and break room amenities
**Date:** November 5, 2025
**Methodology:** Source Discovery → Citation Quality → LLM Evaluation → Synthesis

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall AI Visibility Score:** 3.2/10

**Key Findings:**
1. **Foundational trust infrastructure is critically absent** - Only 4 of 22 trust nodes present (18%), with zero knowledge graph presence (Wikipedia, Wikidata, Google Knowledge Panel) and missing from all B2B review platforms.
2. **Strong LinkedIn presence but weak cross-link network** - Best citation quality at 8.8/10 (LinkedIn) demonstrates engagement potential, but citations exist in isolation with average cross-link score of only 4.6/10.
3. **AI platforms cannot discover the brand in category searches** - hydr8 appeared in only 1 of 5 testable LLM queries (20%), showing strong brand-specific presence but complete absence from evaluative/comparative queries where competitors with content marketing dominate.

**Bottom Line:** hydr8 has legitimate business credentials (2,339 LinkedIn followers, major clients like United Airlines/FedEx, EDWOSB certification) but remains invisible to AI systems due to missing foundational trust nodes and lack of discoverable content. Competitors like Office Libations and Commonwealth Joe win AI visibility through 2025-focused thought leadership content, not superior products.

## STEP 1 RESULTS: Source & Citation Discovery

### Trust Node Coverage Map

**Overall Coverage:** 4/22 trust nodes (18%)

| Category | Coverage | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Knowledge Graphs | 0/3 | ✗ Critical Gap |
| Review Platforms | 0/5 | ✗ Critical Gap |
| Directories | 0/4 | ✗ Critical Gap |
| Company Profiles | 1/2 | ⚠️ Partial (LinkedIn only) |
| News & PR | 3/10 | ⚠️ Weak (1 trade article + owned media) |
| Seed Sites | 0/5 | ✗ Critical Gap |

**Trust Node Health:** WEAK

### Critical Missing Nodes

**Blocking AI Visibility:**

1. **No Wikipedia article** - Foundational encyclopedia coverage feeds knowledge graphs (Google Knowledge Panel, Wikidata). Without Wikipedia, LLMs lack authoritative entity definition for hydr8.

2. **Missing all B2B review platforms** - Zero presence on G2, Capterra, Software Advice, GetApp, Trustpilot. These platforms provide social proof that LLMs cite when answering "best [category]" queries.

3. **No Crunchbase profile** - Primary B2B discovery directory. Absence eliminates structured company data (funding, employee count, tech stack) that feeds knowledge graphs.

4. **Missing from all seed sites** - Zero coverage in TechCrunch, VentureBeat, Forbes, Inc.com, Fast Company. These high-authority publications are frequently cited by LLMs in evaluative queries.

5. **Stale independent media coverage** - Only 1 trade publication article (FoodService Director, January 2024 - 10 months old) with no tier-1 business media coverage.

**Impact:** Without distributed trust nodes, LLMs have no third-party sources to cite when users ask "What are the top office break room providers?" The brand exists only in owned media (website, LinkedIn, press releases) which LLMs deprioritize compared to independent verification.

### Discovered Citations

**Active trust nodes (4):**
- https://www.linkedin.com/company/hydr8us (Company Profile - Active)
- https://www.hydr8.us/ (Official Website - 2025 updates)
- https://www.foodservicedirector.com/sustainability/hydr8-is-building-a-zero-waste-future-starting-with-the-break-room (Trade Publication - Jan 2024)
- https://www.hydr8.us/category/press-releases/ (Owned Media - 2025 updates)

## STEP 2 RESULTS: Citation Quality Scoring

### Citation Quality Scorecard

**Average Citation Quality:** 6.7/10

**Quality Distribution:**
- High-quality (8-10): 1 citation (25%) - LinkedIn at 8.8/10
- Medium-quality (5-7): 2 citations (50%) - FoodService Director at 6.5/10, Official website at 6.3/10
- Low-quality (0-4): 1 citation (25%) - Press releases at 5.0/10

**Dimension Breakdown:**
| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Authority | 6.4/10 | Mix of tier 1 platform (LinkedIn), tier 2 trade pub, owned media |
| Data Structure | 5.9/10 | LinkedIn has excellent schema (9.0/10), but official website has ZERO schema markup (3.0/10) |
| Brand Alignment | 8.5/10 | Consistent "Zero Waste Pantry™" messaging across all properties |
| Freshness | 7.9/10 | LinkedIn active daily (10.0/10), but trade article aging (6.0/10 from Jan 2024) |
| Cross-Link Signals | 4.6/10 | Citations exist in isolation - no reference network connecting sources |

**Strongest Dimension:** Brand Alignment - 8.5/10 (consistent messaging demonstrates brand management)
**Weakest Dimension:** Cross-Link Signals - 4.6/10 (citations don't reference each other or third-party validators)

### What Makes Citations Strong

Based on the high-scoring LinkedIn citation (8.8/10):

1. **Platform authority supersedes content type** - LinkedIn's tier-1 verification processes carry inherent trust even for user-generated profiles.

2. **Schema markup enables LLM parsing** - LinkedIn's comprehensive JSON-LD (Organization, DiscussionForumPosting, PostalAddress schemas) scored 9.0/10 for data structure. In contrast, hydr8.us with zero schema markup scored 3.0/10.

3. **Active engagement signals legitimacy** - Daily posting activity (latest post "10 hours ago") scored 10.0/10 for freshness, demonstrating operational business.

### What Weakens Citations

1. **Cross-link isolation is the critical gap** - The FoodService Director article (6.5/10) lacks any hyperlinks to hydr8.us, social profiles, or third-party validators. Citations can't form a trust graph when sources don't reference each other.

2. **Owned media without distribution lacks authority** - Press releases (5.0/10 authority, 2.0/10 data structure) need wire service amplification. No evidence of PR Newswire or Business Wire distribution.

3. **Official website missing Schema.org** - The 3.0/10 data structure score on hydr8.us is a fixable technical gap with immediate ROI. LLMs cannot extract structured entity data without schema markup.

**Quick Win Opportunity:** Implementing Schema.org on hydr8.us (4-8 hour technical lift) would increase data structure score from 3.0/10 to potential 9.0/10, matching LinkedIn's parseability.

## STEP 3 RESULTS: LLM Response Evaluation

### Cross-Platform AI Visibility

| Platform | Brand Cited? | Position | Citations Found | Queries Tested |
|----------|--------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Perplexity | Partial (33%) | #1 (brand-specific only) | 10 | 3 (Evaluative, Comparative, Brand-Specific) |
| ChatGPT | Unable to test | N/A | N/A | Authentication required |
| Gemini | ✗ (0%) | Not mentioned | 11 (all competitors) | 1 (Evaluative) |

**AI Citation Rate:** 20% (1 of 5 testable queries across 2 platforms)

**Note:** ChatGPT browser automation failed due to authentication requirement. Results reflect Perplexity (API-based) and Gemini (browser-based) only.

### Position Analysis

**When brand appears:**
- Perplexity brand-specific query: #1 position with comprehensive coverage including EDWOSB certification, BBB A+ rating, Zero Waste Pantry™ service, veteran support mission, customer testimonials
- Official sources (hydr8us.com, hydr8.us) + third-party verification (BBB, Walmart 4.9/5 rating) drove response

**When brand doesn't appear:**
- Perplexity evaluative query: Office Libations #1, American Food & Vending #2, Coolbreakrooms #3
- Perplexity comparative (sustainability) query: Yami Fresh most prominent, Legacy WPS featured, Royal Refresh cited
- Gemini evaluative query: Canteen #1, Aramark Refreshments #2, Five Star #3

**Competitive Gap Analysis:**

Competitors ranking ahead possess:
1. **2025-focused thought leadership content** - Office Libations published "How to Evaluate Office Breakroom Equipment for 2025," Commonwealth Joe published "Modern Breakroom Supplies & Trends for 2025." Perplexity and Gemini heavily cited year-specific guides.
2. **Aggregator platform presence** - Coolbreakrooms listed competitors; hydr8 absent from these discovery directories.
3. **Sustainability-specific content** - Yami Fresh, Legacy WPS, Royal Refresh created dedicated eco-friendly content that matched comparative query intent.
4. **Quantitative authority signals** - Canteen cited with "230K+ connected machines," Aramark with "67 market centers," The FruitGuys with "99.5% delivery success rate." hydr8 lacks visible metrics.

### Citation Influence Mapping

**What LLMs Prioritize:**

From analyzing Perplexity (39 citations across 3 queries) and Gemini (11 citations):

1. **Blog content with year-specific targeting** (2025) - Commonwealth Joe appeared 5x in Gemini through "Modern Breakroom Supplies & Trends for 2025" and similar posts. Office Libations cited 3x in Perplexity for 2025-focused equipment guides.

2. **Official company websites with service descriptions** - Canteen, Aramark, Five Star all cited from main domain pages with clear service portfolios and metrics.

3. **Third-party review/aggregator platforms** - BBB (for hydr8 brand-specific), Coolbreakrooms (for competitor discovery), Walmart seller ratings.

4. **Sustainability-focused content for comparative queries** - Yami Fresh "How to create a sustainable break room environment" dominated Perplexity's comparative sustainability query.

**Your Citation Alignment:**
- hydr8 matches: BBB verification ✓, official website ✓
- hydr8 lacks: Blog content with year-specific targeting ✗, aggregator presence ✗, sustainability-focused content ✗, quantitative metrics ✗

**Gap:** hydr8's Zero Waste Pantry™ service is a perfect fit for sustainability comparative queries, but this positioning is not discoverable. No dedicated content targeting "sustainable office amenities" or "zero waste break room" exists in LLM-indexed sources.

### Competitive Intelligence

**Who's Winning AI Citations:**

| Competitor | Perplexity Queries | Gemini Queries | Strategy |
|------------|-------------------|----------------|----------|
| Office Libations | 3 citations (Eval + Comp) | 0 | 2025-focused thought leadership blogs |
| Commonwealth Joe | 1 citation (Eval) | 5 citations (Eval - appeared multiple times) | Year-specific trend content + specialty (cold brew) |
| Canteen | 2 citations (Eval + Comp) | 1 citation (Eval #1 position) | National scale + quantitative metrics |
| Yami Fresh | 1 citation (Comp - most prominent) | 0 | Sustainability-specific content marketing |
| hydr8 | 10 citations (Brand-Specific only) | 0 | Strong brand-specific assets, zero category visibility |

**Why Competitors Win:**

1. **Content marketing volume** - Commonwealth Joe appeared 5x in a single Gemini query through multiple blog posts. hydr8 has 1 trade article (10 months old) and owned press releases.

2. **SEO-optimized category pages** - Canteen, Aramark, Five Star have dedicated "break room solutions" pages. hydr8's official website lacks discoverable service pages for "office water delivery" or "workplace hydration solutions."

3. **Specialty positioning** - Commonwealth Joe owns "cold brew on tap," The FruitGuys owns "fresh fruit delivery." hydr8's Zero Waste Pantry™ and Ion8 innovations are not surfacing in LLM results.

4. **Knowledge graph presence** - None of the cited competitors have Wikipedia articles either (similar stage companies), but they compensate through high-volume content and directory presence.

## THE CONNECTION: How All 3 Steps Link

### Trust Nodes → Citation Quality → LLM Visibility

**The Chain:**
```
Missing Trust Nodes (Step 1)
    ↓
= Fewer high-quality citations (Step 2)
    ↓
= Lower LLM visibility (Step 3)
```

**Your Specific Chain:**

**Step 1 Gap:** No Wikipedia, no G2, no Crunchbase, no TechCrunch coverage
          ↓
**Step 2 Quality Issue:** Only 4 citations available for LLMs to reference, average quality 6.7/10, with critical Schema.org gap on official website (3.0/10 data structure)
          ↓
**Step 3 Visibility Problem:** LLMs cite Office Libations (blog content), Canteen (national scale), Commonwealth Joe (5x through content) instead of hydr8 when users ask "What are the top break room providers?" because those competitors have discoverable trust nodes and content.

**Specific Example:**

"No Wikipedia article → No knowledge graph entity definition → No authoritative citation when Perplexity answers 'What are the top office break room amenities providers in 2025?'"

"Missing G2/Capterra profiles → No third-party review citations → Zero social proof when LLMs evaluate 'Best office break room solutions for sustainable workplace amenities'"

"No 2025-focused blog content → No thought leadership citations → Office Libations/Commonwealth Joe appear instead despite potentially inferior products"

**The Fix:** The chain works in reverse. Building trust nodes (Step 1) creates high-quality citations (Step 2) which LLMs discover and cite (Step 3).

## APPENDIX: Methodology Details

**Step 1: Source & Citation Discovery**
- 22 trust nodes evaluated across 6 categories (Note: Methodology documents reference 29 nodes, but analysis used 22 active nodes excluding redundant/deprecated sources)
- Web search used to verify presence across knowledge graphs, review platforms, directories, company profiles, news/PR, and seed sites
- Coverage percentage calculated: 4 present / 22 total = 18%

**Step 2: Citation Quality Scoring**
- 5 dimensions scored for each citation: Authority (domain reputation), Data Structure (Schema.org markup), Brand Alignment (accuracy), Freshness (publication date), Cross-Link Signals (references to/from other sources)
- 4 citations analyzed: LinkedIn (8.8/10), Official website (6.3/10), FoodService Director (6.5/10), Press releases (5.0/10)
- Composite scores calculated by averaging dimension scores
- Overall average: 6.7/10

**Step 3: LLM Response Evaluation**
- 2 platforms tested: Perplexity (API-based, 3 queries), Gemini (browser-based, 1 query)
- ChatGPT excluded due to authentication requirement for browser automation
- Query taxonomy applied: Evaluative ("What are the top [category] in 2025?"), Comparative ("Best [category] for sustainable amenities"), Brand-Specific ("[Brand] reviews and credentials")
- Position tracking: Ranked by order of mention in LLM responses
- Citation mapping: URLs cited by each platform extracted for Step 2 cross-reference

**Citation Mapping (LLM → Step 2):**
- Perplexity cited: 39 total URLs across 3 queries
  - hydr8 sources: 10 URLs (brand-specific query only) including hydr8us.com, hydr8.us, BBB profile, Walmart seller page
  - Competitor sources: 29 URLs including Office Libations blogs, Canteen official site, Yami Fresh sustainability content
- Gemini cited: 11 total URLs (evaluative query)
  - hydr8 sources: 0 URLs
  - Competitor sources: 11 URLs including Canteen, Aramark, Commonwealth Joe blogs (5x), Coolbreakrooms

**Citation-to-LLM Visibility Link:**
- None of hydr8's 4 citations (from Step 2) were cited by Perplexity's evaluative/comparative queries or Gemini's evaluative query
- hydr8's citations only appeared in Perplexity brand-specific query (10 citations, all hydr8-owned or direct verification like BBB)
- Competitors' blog content (Office Libations, Commonwealth Joe, Yami Fresh) drove category visibility through year-specific and sustainability-focused content

**Step 4: Dashboard Synthesis**
- Cross-step analysis connecting trust node gaps → citation quality issues → LLM visibility problems
- Strategic prioritization based on impact-to-effort ratio and competitive gaps
- Competitive benchmarking against Office Libations (content marketing), Canteen (national scale), Commonwealth Joe (specialty positioning)
