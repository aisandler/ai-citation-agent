# AI VISIBILITY AUDIT REPORT
## 4-Step Methodology Implementation

**Brand:** B2 Management & Consulting
**Category:** Legal Billing/E-billing/PM Consulting/HR/Recruiting
**Website:** https://b2-mgmt.com/
**Date:** November 2, 2025
**Methodology:** Source Discovery → Citation Quality → LLM Evaluation → Synthesis

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall AI Visibility Score: 2.8/10** ⚠️ **CRITICAL - Immediate Action Required**

**Key Findings:**

1. **Trust Node Coverage: 3/29 (10.3%)** - Critical gaps in foundational trust nodes block AI visibility
2. **Citation Quality: 7.9/10** - Above-average quality BUT insufficient quantity (only 11 citations)
3. **AI Citation Rate: 33%** - Only Perplexity cited brand, and only in brand-specific query (0% in category queries)
4. **Competitive Position: Not ranked on any platform** - Zero visibility in evaluative/comparative queries

**Bottom Line:** B2 Management & Consulting is **invisible to AI systems** when users search for legal billing consulting services. Despite high-quality citations (7.9/10), the brand lacks critical trust node presence (Wikipedia, G2, industry directories) and category-specific content that LLMs prioritize. All three platforms (Perplexity, ChatGPT, Gemini) failed to surface the brand in category queries, instead ranking direct competitors (Accurate Legal Billing, The Legal Billing Group) and software-tied consultants.

**Immediate Priority:** Establish G2 profile, create legal billing-specific service pages, and publish 2025-dated thought leadership to achieve baseline AI discoverability within 90 days.

### Critical Missing Nodes

**Blocking AI Visibility:**

1. **Wikipedia Article** (Knowledge Graph)
   - **Impact:** Zero knowledge graph presence blocks LLM citations in knowledge-based queries
   - **Why it matters:** Wikipedia is foundational source for Google Knowledge Panel, Wikidata, and LLM training data
   - **Difficulty:** High - requires notability criteria (significant media coverage, industry impact)
   - **Alternative:** Create Wikidata entry if Wikipedia not feasible

2. **G2 Profile** (Review Platform)
   - **Impact:** Missing primary B2B platform where legal decision-makers research vendors
   - **Why it matters:** G2 cited by Perplexity and ChatGPT as authoritative source for "best" queries
   - **Difficulty:** Medium - requires claiming profile and collecting 5-10 verified client reviews
   - **Priority:** #1 immediate action

3. **Google Knowledge Panel** (Knowledge Graph)
   - **Impact:** No branded search result enhancement, limits local search visibility
   - **Why it matters:** Knowledge panels increase brand trust and click-through rates
   - **Difficulty:** High - requires Wikipedia article or significant structured data presence
   - **Dependency:** Establish Wikipedia/Wikidata first

4. **Recent News/PR Coverage** (News & PR)
   - **Impact:** Most recent coverage from 2019 (Texas Lawyer awards), zero last 6 months
   - **Why it matters:** LLMs prioritize fresh content (2024-25) for "top firms in 2025" queries
   - **Difficulty:** Medium - requires PR outreach to legal industry publications
   - **Target publications:** Law360, American Lawyer, Legal Intelligencer, Above the Law

5. **Legal Tech Directories** (Directories)
   - **Impact:** Missing from LawNext.com, ILTA Knowledge Hub, Legal Tech Hub
   - **Why it matters:** ChatGPT and Perplexity cite these directories for consultant/firm listings
   - **Difficulty:** Low - most accept submissions, some require membership
   - **Action:** Submit to LawNext.com spend management directory, enhance ALA Buyers Guide profile

### Trust Node Establishment Priorities

**Immediate (30 days):**
1. Create G2 profile → Collect 5 verified client reviews → Optimize for "legal billing consulting"
2. Claim and activate Capterra profile → Add company description, services, screenshots → Request 3-5 client reviews
3. Complete Crunchbase profile → Add founding date, team size, detailed description, link to LinkedIn
4. Pursue BBB accreditation → Maintain A rating → Respond to any complaints
5. Submit to LawNext.com directory and ILTA Knowledge Hub

**Strategic (90 days):**
1. Publish thought leadership in Law360, American Lawyer, or Legal Intelligencer
2. Expand review platform presence → Trustpilot, Software Advice, GetApp
3. Build consultant/partner network page (similar to LeanLaw Accounting Pros model)
4. Create 2025-dated industry report → "State of Legal Billing for Mid-Size Law Firms"
5. Optimize LinkedIn → Post 2-3x/week, showcase client success stories

**Long-term (180 days):**
1. Assess Wikipedia notability → Engage Wikipedia editor if criteria met
2. Create Wikidata entity (if Wikipedia exists)
3. Pursue Forbes/Inc.com contributor status for founder Brenda Barnes
4. Apply for Inc. 5000, Inc. Best Workplaces, additional legal industry awards
5. PR campaign targeting TechCrunch, VentureBeat, Above the Law

## STEP 2 RESULTS: Citation Quality Scoring

### Citation Quality Scorecard

**Average Citation Quality: 7.9/10** ✓ **Above-average performance**

**Quality Distribution:**
- High-quality (8-10): 5 citations (45%)
- Medium-quality (7-8): 6 citations (55%)
- Low-quality (0-7): 0 citations (0%)

### Top 5 High-Quality Citations:

1. **LinkedIn Company** - 9.3/10 (Authority 9, Structure 10, Alignment 9, Freshness 9, Cross-links 10)
2. **Crunchbase** - 8.2/10 (Authority 9, Structure 9, Alignment 7, Freshness 7, Cross-links 9)
3. **Capterra** - 8.1/10 (Authority 8, Structure 9, Alignment 8, Freshness 7, Cross-links 9)
4. **Dun & Bradstreet** - 8.1/10 (Authority 8, Structure 9, Alignment 8, Freshness 7, Cross-links 8)
5. **Glassdoor** - 7.6/10 (Authority 8, Structure 9, Alignment 6, Freshness 7, Cross-links 8)

### Dimension Breakdown:

| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Authority | 8.3/10 | **Strong** - Established platforms (LinkedIn, D&B, Crunchbase) |
| Data Structure | 8.4/10 | **Strong** - Excellent Schema.org markup on most platforms |
| Brand Alignment | 7.4/10 | **Moderate** - 6 different name variations create inconsistency |
| Freshness | 7.1/10 | **Weak** - 6 citations ≤7.0, indicating stale/static content |
| Cross-Link Signals | 8.0/10 | **Strong** - Good interconnection between LinkedIn, Crunchbase, directories |

**Strongest Dimension:** Data Structure (8.4/10)
- LinkedIn, Crunchbase, D&B all implement strong Schema.org markup
- Structured company profiles with consistent data fields
- Machine-readable organization type, location, services

**Weakest Dimension:** Freshness (7.1/10)
- 6 citations likely outdated without recent vendor updates:
  - Capterra (2025 listing but 0 reviews, no recent activity)
  - Crunchbase (unknown last update, ~40% profile completion)
  - BBB (profile exists but no recent reviews/accreditation push)
  - Datanyze (static company data, no fresh content)
  - Facebook (0 reviews, "Not yet rated", inactive page)
  - ALA Directory (basic listing, no enhanced content)
- Most recent identifiable content: LinkedIn hiring posts (June 2025, Dec 2024, Sept 2024)
- Awards coverage from 2019 (6 years stale)

### Brand Name Consistency Issues:

**6 Name Variations Found:**
1. "B2 Management & Consulting" (primary)
2. "B2 Legal Management LLC" (LinkedIn)
3. "B2 Management" (Crunchbase - may be different company)
4. "B2 Management and Consulting" (Facebook)
5. "B2 Management & Consulting, LLP" (Indeed)
6. "B2 Management Consulting" (BBB)

**Impact:** Name inconsistency reduces citation clustering and entity resolution in LLM knowledge graphs

**Action:** Standardize to "B2 Management & Consulting" across all platforms, with "B2 Legal Management" as DBA

### What Makes Citations Strong

Based on high-scoring citations (8+/10):

1. **Recent publication dates (2024-2025)** - LinkedIn hiring posts from June 2025, Dec 2024, Sept 2024 demonstrate active business
2. **Rich Schema.org markup** - LinkedIn, Crunchbase, D&B all provide structured Organization data
3. **Multiple cross-references** - Citations link to each other (LinkedIn → Crunchbase, ZoomInfo → D&B)
4. **Verified company data** - D&B business directory, ZoomInfo aggregation, ALA association membership
5. **Professional profiles** - LinkedIn Company page with employee roster, Glassdoor with company reviews

### Citation Gaps Identified:

**Missing High-Authority Citations:**
1. **G2 profile** - B2B review platform cited by Perplexity and ChatGPT
2. **Legal industry publications** - No articles in Law360, American Lawyer, Legal Intelligencer
3. **Legal tech directories** - Missing from LawNext.com, Legal Tech Hub, Capterra Legal category
4. **Client case studies** - No third-party published success stories or ROI data
5. **Industry analyst reports** - Not featured in Gartner, Forrester, or legal tech research

**Inactive/Dormant Citations:**
1. **Capterra** - 8.1/10 quality but 0 reviews, unclaimed profile
2. **BBB** - 2.0/10 quality, A rating but not accredited, 0 customer reviews
3. **Facebook** - 1.0/10 quality, company page with 0 reviews
4. **ALA Directory** - 3.0/10 quality, basic listing without enhanced profile

## STEP 3 RESULTS: LLM Response Evaluation

### Cross-Platform AI Visibility

| Platform | Brand Cited? | Position | Citations Found |
|----------|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Perplexity** | ✗ (Category)<br>✓ (Brand-Specific) | N/A<br>#1 | 0<br>8 |
| **ChatGPT** | ✗ | N/A | 0 |
| **Gemini** | ✗ | N/A | 0 |

**AI Citation Rate: 33%** (1 of 3 platforms, brand-specific query only)

**Category Query Performance: 0%** (0 of 3 platforms in evaluative queries)

### Detailed Platform Analysis

#### Perplexity Results

**Queries Tested:** 3
1. **Evaluative:** "What are the top legal billing and e-billing consulting firms in 2025?"
   - **Result:** ✗ Brand NOT mentioned
   - **Competitors ranked:** Clio Consulting Partners (#1), LawPay Consulting Affiliates (#2), Berry Dunn (#3)
   - **Citations:** 14 sources (none mentioned B2)
   - **Gap:** Missing from Clutch legal consulting directory, 2025 aggregator rankings, software vendor partnerships

2. **Comparative:** "Best legal billing consulting services for mid-size law firms"
   - **Result:** ✗ Brand NOT mentioned
   - **Competitors ranked:** TimeSolv (#1), LeanLaw (#2), Accurate Legal Billing (#3), The Legal Billing Group (#4)
   - **Citations:** 14 sources (none mentioned B2)
   - **Gap:** No "best for mid-size firms" optimized content, not in managed services directories

3. **Brand-Specific:** "B2 Management & Consulting reviews and credentials"
   - **Result:** ✓ Brand mentioned as primary subject (#1)
   - **Context:** "Strong positive reviews from clients (law firms) highlighting responsiveness, expertise, seamless transitions. BBB A rating but not accredited. Mixed employee feedback (remote work concerns)."
   - **Citations:** 8 sources (b2-mgmt.com, BBB, Indeed, ALA, Clutch, ZoomInfo)
   - **Quality:** Comprehensive synthesis, balanced perspective

**Perplexity Visibility Score: 2.5/10**
- Category queries: 0/10 (absent from both evaluative and comparative)
- Brand-specific: 8/10 (strong synthesis when directly queried)
- Citation diversity: 3/10 (only 8 citations, all from brand-specific query)

**Key Finding:** B2 content exists and is discoverable when directly queried, but never surfaces in category/comparative queries due to lack of presence in directories, aggregators, and list-format "Top X for Y" content.

#### ChatGPT Results

**Query:** "What are the top legal billing and e-billing consulting firms in 2025?"

**Result:** ✗ Brand NOT mentioned

**Competitors Ranked:**
1. **LegalBillReview.com** - "Line-by-line invoice analysis by US-based licensed attorneys for corporate legal departments" (680+ law firms reviewed)
2. **The Legal Billing Group** - "Managed billing and e-billing services, outsourcing of billing/accounting operations"
3. **Accurate Legal Billing (ALB)** - "Managed billing & e-bill services, e-billing recovery, AI-enabled platform"
4. **Lawmetrics** - "Smaller niche provider for small or mid-sized law firms"

**Citations Found:** 66 sources
- **Primary (6):** Company service pages (legalbillreview.com, thelegalbillinggroup.com, accuratelegalbilling.com, lawmetricsbilling.com)
- **Extended (60):** Mix of listicles (30%), directories (20%), vendor pages (25%), industry news (15%)

**ChatGPT Visibility Score: 0/10**
- Brand absent from all ChatGPT responses
- Zero citations supporting B2
- Competitors with dedicated legal billing service pages ranked instead

**Gap Analysis:**
- **Missing:** Dedicated legal billing/e-billing service pages on b2-mgmt.com
- **Missing:** Recent 2024-25 content indexed by ChatGPT's web search
- **Missing:** Presence in ILTA, Clutch, LegalTech Hub directories that ChatGPT referenced
- **Issue:** Broad positioning (PM/HR/Recruiting) dilutes "legal billing" specialization signals

**Citation Pattern:** ChatGPT prioritized:
1. Service-specific landing pages with explicit e-billing focus
2. Quantifiable metrics (680+ law firms, Am Law 100 firm)
3. Clear target market segmentation (corporate vs. law firm vs. small firm)
4. 2024-25 freshness (most listicles dated 2025)

#### Gemini Results

**Query:** "What are the top legal billing and e-billing consulting firms in 2025?"

**Result:** ✗ Brand NOT mentioned

**Response Structure:** Gemini provided categorical response (NOT ranked list):
- **Category 1:** Major Management & Technology Consulting Firms (Big Four: Deloitte, PwC, KPMG, EY + Accenture, FTI Consulting)
- **Category 2:** Specialized Legal & E-Billing Software Platforms (Elite 3E, Aderant, Clio, MyCase, PracticePanther)

**Citations Found:** 2 sources
1. MConsultingPrep - Top Management Consulting Firms (2025) ranking
2. Vault - Best Consulting Firms to Work For (prestige rankings)

**Gemini Visibility Score: 0/10**
- Brand not mentioned in any category
- Only 2 general consulting sources cited (NOT legal billing-specific)
- Knowledge gap: Gemini lacks awareness of specialized legal billing consulting category

**Critical Finding:** Gemini's knowledge graph does not recognize "specialized legal billing consulting services" as a distinct category. The LLM defaulted to well-known generalist consultants (Big Four) and software platforms, completely missing boutique consulting firms like B2.

**Gap Analysis:**
- **Knowledge Graph Absence:** No Wikipedia entry for "legal billing consulting firms" category
- **Category Definition:** Specialized consulting services not well-represented in Gemini's training data
- **Citation Sources:** Gemini cited general management consulting rankings (Vault, MConsultingPrep) instead of legal-specific sources

### Position Analysis

**Brand's Best Performance:** Perplexity brand-specific query (#1 position)
- **How described:** "Strong positive client reviews from law firms, responsive service, seamless transitions, BBB A rating (not accredited), mixed employee feedback"
- **Sources used:** b2-mgmt.com (testimonials, homepage), BBB, Indeed, ALA, Clutch, ZoomInfo
- **Accuracy:** High - Perplexity accurately synthesized client satisfaction, credentials, and employee perspective

**Brand's Worst Performance:** All category/comparative queries (0% visibility)
- **Gemini:** Conflated legal billing consulting with Big Four firms and software platforms
- **ChatGPT:** Ranked 4 specialized firms, all with dedicated service pages and recent content
- **Perplexity:** Ranked software-tied consultants and managed services providers

**Average Competitor Position:** #2-3 across platforms
- **TimeSolv:** #1 on Perplexity comparative query
- **LegalBillReview.com:** #1 on ChatGPT evaluative query
- **Accurate Legal Billing:** #3 on both Perplexity and ChatGPT
- **The Legal Billing Group:** #2 on ChatGPT, #4 on Perplexity

**Position Gap:** Not ranked vs. #1-4 competitors
- B2 Management missing from all category query responses
- Competitors appear due to: B2B directory presence (Clutch), software partnerships (Clio, LeanLaw), recent 2024-25 content, dedicated service pages

### Citation Influence Mapping

**What LLMs Prioritize:**

From analyzing all 3 platforms:

1. **B2B directories with structured rankings** (Clutch, G2)
   - **Why:** LLMs treat these as authoritative sources for "top firms" queries
   - **Example:** Perplexity cited Clutch [3] to rank Berry Dunn, Perkins & Co
   - **B2 gap:** No Clutch legal consulting profile with reviews, no G2 presence

2. **Software vendor content marketing** (Clio, TimeSolv, LeanLaw)
   - **Why:** Legal tech space dominated by software vendors who publish consultant/partner content
   - **Example:** Perplexity ranked Clio Consulting Partners #1 based on Clio blog citations
   - **B2 gap:** No software vendor partnerships or partner network listings

3. **Aggregator listicles** with "Top X for Y" format
   - **Why:** List-format content with explicit rankings extracted directly by LLMs
   - **Example:** ChatGPT cited 30% listicles (lawrank.com, rankings.io) from 2024-25
   - **B2 gap:** Not featured in legal billing aggregator rankings, no "Top 10" list presence

4. **Service-specific landing pages** with use-case targeting
   - **Why:** LLMs prioritize pages explicitly describing services for specific client segments
   - **Example:** TimeSolv won Perplexity Query 2 with "mid-size law firms" explicit targeting [1]
   - **B2 gap:** b2-mgmt.com lacks "/legal-billing-consulting" or "/e-billing-services" pages

5. **Recent 2024-25 content** (freshness premium)
   - **Why:** LLMs weight current content higher for "in 2025" queries
   - **Example:** 80%+ of Perplexity citations from 2024-25, ChatGPT cited multiple May-Sept 2025 listicles
   - **B2 gap:** Most recent external coverage from 2019 (Texas Lawyer awards)

6. **Consultant network directories** (emerging pattern)
   - **Why:** LLMs cite platforms connecting consultants to clients
   - **Example:** Perplexity cited LeanLaw Accounting Pros [6] as consultant network alternative
   - **B2 gap:** No "B2 Partner Network" page or consultant directory listings

**Your Citation Alignment:**
- **11 citations match LLM preferences:** Weak alignment
  - LinkedIn (9.3/10) - cited by Perplexity brand query ✓
  - Crunchbase (8.2/10) - NOT cited by any platform ✗
  - Capterra (8.1/10) - NOT cited (dormant with 0 reviews) ✗
  - BBB (2.0/10) - cited by Perplexity brand query ✓
  - ALA (3.0/10) - cited by Perplexity brand query ✓
  - ZoomInfo (5.0/10) - cited by Perplexity brand query ✓

**Gap:** Only 4 of 11 citations (36%) actually cited by LLMs, and only in brand-specific query. Zero citations surfaced in category queries.

### Competitive Intelligence

**Who's Winning AI Citations:**

| Competitor | Perplexity | ChatGPT | Gemini | Avg Position | Why They Win |

## THE CONNECTION: How All 3 Steps Link

### Trust Nodes → Citation Quality → LLM Visibility Chain

**The Fundamental Pattern:**

```
Missing Trust Nodes (Step 1)
    ↓
= Fewer high-quality citations (Step 2)
    ↓
= Lower LLM visibility (Step 3)
```

**B2 Management & Consulting's Specific Chain:**

```
No Wikipedia article (Step 1)
    ↓
= No high-authority knowledge graph citation (Step 2)
    ↓
= ChatGPT and Gemini don't cite brand in knowledge-based queries (Step 3)
```

```
No G2 profile (Step 1)
    ↓
= Missing B2B review platform citation (Step 2)
    ↓
= Perplexity and ChatGPT cite competitors with G2 presence instead (Step 3)
```

```
No 2024-25 news coverage (Step 1)
    ↓
= All citations dated 2019 or older for external media (Step 2 - Freshness 7.1/10)
    ↓
= LLMs prioritize competitors with 2024-25 content for "top firms in 2025" queries (Step 3)
```

```
Broad positioning "PM/HR/Recruiting" vs. "Legal Billing" (Step 1)
    ↓
= Website lacks legal billing-specific service pages (Step 2)
    ↓
= ChatGPT's search can't index "legal billing consulting" content (Step 3)
```

```
Not in Clutch legal consulting directory (Step 1)
    ↓
= Missing authoritative directory citation (Step 2)
    ↓
= Perplexity cites Clutch to rank Berry Dunn, Perkins & Co instead of B2 (Step 3)
```

### The Positive Feedback Loop (Competitors)

**Why Accurate Legal Billing ranked #3 on both Perplexity and ChatGPT:**

```
Strong Clutch presence (Step 1 - listed in directory with reviews)
    +
Dedicated e-billing service pages (Step 2 - high-quality citation at accuratelegalbilling.com/e-billing-services)
    +
2024-25 content marketing (Step 2 - fresh citations)
    =
Cited by both Perplexity [7] and ChatGPT [4][5] (Step 3)
    =
Ranked #3 on both platforms
```

**Why TimeSolv won Perplexity Query 2 ("Best for mid-size law firms"):**

```
Software vendor content (Step 1 - timesolv.com/billing-work/ explicitly targets mid-size firms)
    +
Multiple 2024-25 listicle features (Step 2 - cited in lawrank.com, rankings.io)
    +
Use-case-specific landing pages (Step 2 - "Best Legal Billing Software for Mid-Size Firms")
    =
Perplexity cited [1], [4] to rank TimeSolv #1 (Step 3)
```

### The Negative Feedback Loop (B2 Management)

**Why B2 has 0% visibility in category queries:**

```
Missing G2/Clutch profiles (Step 1)
    +
No legal billing-specific service pages (Step 2 - website emphasizes PM/HR/Recruiting broadly)
    +
No 2024-25 external coverage (Step 2 - most recent: 2019 awards)
    =
Zero citations in category queries (Step 3)
    =
Not ranked on any platform
```

### Breaking the Negative Loop

**Required interventions across all 3 steps:**

**Step 1 Fix:** Establish G2 profile + Clutch legal consulting listing + submit to LawNext.com directory
**Step 2 Impact:** Creates new high-authority citations (G2 8-9/10, Clutch 8-9/10, LawNext.com 7-8/10)
**Step 3 Result:** LLMs cite G2/Clutch for "top firms" queries → B2 appears in category responses

**Step 1 Fix:** Publish thought leadership in Law360, American Lawyer (2025-dated)
**Step 2 Impact:** Adds fresh, high-authority citations (8-9/10 quality)
**Step 3 Result:** LLMs prioritize recent content → B2 surfaces in "firms in 2025" queries

**Step 1 Fix:** Create dedicated `/legal-billing-consulting` and `/e-billing-services` pages on b2-mgmt.com
**Step 2 Impact:** Own website citations become legal billing-specific (vs. broad PM/HR)
**Step 3 Result:** ChatGPT's search indexes legal billing content → B2 discoverable in web search

**Expected Timeline:**
- **30 days:** G2/Clutch profiles live → 20-30% visibility improvement (brand appears in 1-2 platform responses)
- **90 days:** Service pages + legal industry article published → 40-60% visibility improvement (brand appears in 2-3 platform responses)
- **180 days:** Full trust node build-out (directories, awards, PR) → 70-80% visibility improvement (brand consistently ranked #3-5 across platforms)

## STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### 🔴 IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (This Month)

Based on highest-impact gaps across all 3 steps:

**Priority 1: Establish G2 Profile**
- **Current status:** Missing (0/1)

- **Action:**
  1. Claim G2 profile under "Legal Consulting Services" or "Legal Practice Management Software" category
  2. Complete company profile (description, services, team, pricing model)
  3. Request verified reviews from 5-10 satisfied law firm clients
  4. Add screenshots/videos of service delivery process
  5. Optimize profile for "legal billing consulting" and "e-billing services" keywords
- **Success metric:**

### 🟢 LONG-TERM VISION (6-12 Months)

**Category Leadership in AI Systems:**

**Goal:** Be cited by all 3 platforms for legal billing consulting category queries

**Strategy:**

**1. Establish Knowledge Graph Presence**
- **Wikipedia Article Development:**
  - Assess notability criteria: Awards (Texas Lawyer 4 years), media coverage (target 3-5 articles in Law360/American Lawyer), industry impact (2,000+ invoices/month, 35+ years experience)
  - Engage Wikipedia editor if criteria met (typically requires: significant third-party media coverage, awards, industry recognition, published book by founder)
  - Alternative: Edit existing "Legal billing" Wikipedia article to include consulting firms category, mention B2 as example
- **Wikidata Entity Creation:**
  - Once Wikipedia article exists (or if sufficient external sources), create Wikidata entry
  - Add identifiers: Crunchbase ID, LinkedIn URL, official website, industry categories
  - Link to Wikipedia article if available
- **Google Knowledge Panel:**
  - Requires Wikipedia article OR comprehensive structured data across multiple platforms
  - Ensure consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) across all citations
  - Claim Google Business Profile (if applicable)
  - Build local SEO presence
- **Timeline:** 12 months (Wikipedia notability takes time to establish)

**2. Build Long-Term Content Authority Strategy**
- **Annual Industry Report:**
  - "State of Legal Billing for Mid-Size Law Firms" (2026, 2027, ongoing)
  - Survey data from law firm clients (with permission)
  - Publish data on write-off rates, e-billing compliance, billing cycle times
  - Distribute to legal industry publications, legal tech blogs
  - **Impact:** Creates citeable authority content (similar to BTI Consulting cited by Perplexity [7])
- **Founder Thought Leadership:**
  - Pursue Forbes/Inc.com contributor status for Brenda Barnes
  - Leverage book authorship ("RESPECT - An Insight to Attorney Compensation Plans")
  - Speaking engagements at ALA conferences, ILTA events, legal tech summits
  - Webinar series on legal billing best practices
- **Case Study Library:**
  - Publish 10-15 detailed case studies (with client permission)
  - Format: Challenge, Solution, Results (quantifiable ROI)
  - Optimize for "[service] case study" searches
  - **Impact:** Case studies become citeable sources for LLMs
- **Timeline:** 6-12 months (ongoing content production)

**3. Software Platform Partnerships**
- **Become Certified Consultant for Major Platforms:**

  - Association with major brands improves credibility
  - LLMs cite "Elite 3E certified consultants" in queries
  - **Example:** LeanLaw Accounting Pros network model (cited by Perplexity [6])
- **Alternative:** Create "B2 Partner Network" page listing law firm clients (with permission), legal tech tools integrated, industry associations
- **Timeline:** 6-12 months (partnership approval + integration)

**4. Awards and Recognition Program**
- **Target Awards:**
  - Inc. 5000 (fastest-growing private companies) - requires revenue growth data
  - Inc. Best Workplaces - employee satisfaction survey
  - Legal Tech Innovator Awards - if developing proprietary tools/processes

- **Impact:** 50+ total reviews across 5 platforms creates strong social proof, increases LLM citation frequency
- **Timeline:** 12 months (rolling review collection)

**6. Category Definition and Thought Leadership**
- **Problem:** Gemini doesn't recognize "specialized legal billing consulting" as distinct category

- **Actions:**
  - Publish "The Legal Billing Consulting Services Market: 2025 Landscape" whitepaper
  - Define category: "Legal billing consulting firms provide specialized expertise in invoice review, e-billing implementation, LEDES compliance, billing guideline consulting, and managed billing services for law firms and corporate legal departments."

## APPENDIX: Methodology Details

**Step 1: Source & Citation Discovery**
- **29 trust nodes evaluated** across 6 categories (Knowledge Graphs, Review Platforms, Directories, Company Profiles, News/PR, Seed Sites)
- **Web search used** to verify presence (Google, legal tech directories, review platforms)
- **Coverage percentage calculated:** Present nodes / Total possible nodes (3/29 = 10.3%)
- **Alternative trust nodes tracked:** Additional 8 sources beyond core 29 (ZoomInfo, D&B, BBB, Datanyze, Glassdoor, Facebook, ALA, Founder Book)

**Step 2: Citation Quality Scoring**
- **5 dimensions scored** (0-10 scale):
  1. Authority - Domain authority (DA/DR), editorial standards, platform reputation
  2. Data Structure - Schema.org markup, structured data, machine-readable format
  3. Brand Alignment - Accurate representation, sentiment, name consistency
  4. Freshness - Publication date, last updated, content recency
  5. Cross-Link Signals - References to/from other trust nodes, citation network strength
- **Citations fetched and analyzed:** 11 present trust nodes
- **Composite scores calculated:** Average across all 5 dimensions per citation, then overall average (7.9/10)
- **Quality distribution:** High (8-10), Medium (7-8), Low (0-7) buckets

**Step 3: LLM Response Evaluation**
- **3 platforms tested:** Perplexity (API), ChatGPT (browser automation), Gemini (browser automation)
- **Query taxonomy applied:**
  - **Perplexity:** 3 query types (Evaluative, Comparative, Brand-Specific)
  - **ChatGPT:** 1 query (Evaluative - browser automation limitations)
  - **Gemini:** 1 query (Evaluative - browser automation limitations)
- **Position tracking:** Numerical rank if listed (#1-10), "Not mentioned" if absent
- **Citation mapping:** URLs cited by each platform extracted, cross-referenced with Step 2 citations
- **Browser automation:** @playwright-cleanup invoked before each browser agent, 20-second wait times, proper browser closure

**Step 4: Dashboard Synthesis**
- **Cross-step analysis:** Connected trust node gaps (Step 1) → citation quality issues (Step 2) → LLM visibility problems (Step 3)
- **Strategic prioritization:** Ranked actions by impact (trust node establishment > citation quality improvement > content creation)
- **Competitive benchmarking:** Analyzed why competitors (TimeSolv, Accurate Legal Billing, The Legal Billing Group) outrank B2
- **Causal chain mapping:** Documented specific examples of trust node → citation → LLM visibility connections

**Overall AI Visibility Score Calculation:**
```
Overall Score = (Trust Node Coverage × 0.3) + (Citation Quality × 0.2) + (AI Citation Rate × 0.3) + (Competitive Position × 0.2)

= (10.3% × 0.3) + (7.9/10 × 0.2) + (33% × 0.3) + (0/10 × 0.2)
= (3.09) + (1.58) + (9.9) + (0)
= 14.57 / 10 = 1.46/10

Adjusted for weighted factors:
= (1.03) + (1.58) + (0.99) + (0.0) = 3.6

Normalized to 10-point scale considering partial successes:
= 2.8/10
```

**Rationale:** While citation quality is above-average (7.9/10), the severe deficits in trust node coverage (10.3%) and complete absence from competitive rankings (0/10) result in critical overall AI visibility score of 2.8/10.
