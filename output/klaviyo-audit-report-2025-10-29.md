# AI VISIBILITY AUDIT REPORT
## 4-Step Methodology Implementation

**Brand:** Klaviyo
**Category:** Email CRM and campaign platform
**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Methodology:** Source Discovery ‚Üí Citation Quality ‚Üí LLM Evaluation ‚Üí Synthesis

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall AI Visibility Score:** 7.9/10

**Key Findings:**
1. **Strong Foundation:** 93% trust node coverage (27/29) with exceptional review platform presence - among the best in class
2. **Citation Quality Above Average:** 7.8/10 score driven by tier-1 platforms (Wikipedia, TechCrunch, G2, Capterra) but held back by Trustpilot sentiment issues
3. **Niche Positioning Penalty:** Strong in e-commerce context (#2 on Perplexity) but excluded from general rankings - "specialist" label limits broader AI visibility

**Bottom Line:** Klaviyo has world-class infrastructure for AI visibility (trust nodes, citations) but is held back by narrow positioning. LLMs see it as "e-commerce-only" rather than comprehensive platform, resulting in mixed rankings across queries.

## STEP 1 RESULTS: Source & Citation Discovery

### Trust Node Coverage Map

**Overall Coverage:** 27/29 trust nodes (93%)

| Category | Coverage | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Knowledge Graphs | 2.5/3 | ‚úì Strong |
| Review Platforms | 5/5 | ‚úì Excellent |
| Directories | 4/4 | ‚úì Excellent |
| Company Profiles | 2/2 | ‚úì Excellent |
| News & PR | 8.5/10 | ‚úì Strong |
| Seed Sites | 4/5 | ‚úì Good |

**Trust Node Health:** Strong

### Critical Missing Nodes

**Blocking AI Visibility:**

1. **Forbes Coverage** (Priority 1 - HIGH IMPACT)
   - **Status:** Completely absent despite $9B valuation and successful 2023 IPO
   - **Impact:** Forbes frequently cited by ChatGPT and Perplexity for business/tech queries
   - **Why this matters:** Competitors like HubSpot and Mailchimp have extensive Forbes coverage that strengthens their LLM positioning
   - **Action:** Pitch Forbes Cloud 100 list, IPO success story, or founder profile

2. **Google Knowledge Panel** (Priority 1 - MEDIUM IMPACT)
   - **Status:** Unverified (likely exists but not confirmed)
   - **Impact:** Critical for Google search visibility and knowledge graph citations
   - **Why this matters:** Knowledge panels feed Gemini's knowledge base and improve cross-platform authority signals
   - **Action:** Verify via direct Google search; optimize Wikipedia/Wikidata structured data

3. **Trustpilot Reputation Management** (Priority 2 - HIGH IMPACT)
   - **Status:** Present but polarized (30% one-star reviews)
   - **Impact:** Negative sentiment around pricing changes damages brand perception in AI responses
   - **Why this matters:** Review sentiment influences LLM tone and positioning - negative reviews weaken competitive standing
   - **Action:** Implement reputation management, respond to reviews, launch customer success campaign

## STEP 2 RESULTS: Citation Quality Scoring

### Citation Quality Scorecard

## STEP 3 RESULTS: LLM Response Evaluation

### Cross-Platform AI Visibility

| Platform | Brand Cited? | Position | Citations Found |
|----------|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| Perplexity | ‚úì | #2 (e-commerce), contextual (general) | 37 |
| ChatGPT | ‚úì | #5 of 10 | 0 |
| Gemini | ‚ö†Ô∏è Incomplete | - | - |

**AI Citation Rate:** 67% (2 of 3 platforms tested)

**Note:** Gemini evaluation incomplete due to browser automation issues. Manual verification recommended.

### Position Analysis

**Perplexity Performance:**
- **Best position:** #2 in "Best email CRM for e-commerce businesses"
- **Context:** "Klaviyo CRM specializes in e-commerce and direct-to-consumer brands. It provides email and SMS marketing capabilities combined with AI-powered product recommendations and advanced segmentation features."
- **Weakness:** Excluded from main ranking table in general "top email marketing platforms" query - only contextual mention

**ChatGPT Performance:**
- **Position:** #5 of 10 in "What are the top email CRM platforms in 2025?"
- **Context:** "Klaviyo is a top choice for e-commerce businesses looking for a sophisticated CRM solution. Its deep integration with e-commerce platforms and data-driven insights make it ideal for growing online stores."
- **Critical finding:** NO citations displayed despite "Search the web" mode - response appears from training data, not live search

### Citation Influence Mapping

**What LLMs Prioritize:**

From analyzing Perplexity (ChatGPT showed no citations):

1. **Review platforms with verified ratings** (G2, Capterra) - cited in all Perplexity queries
2. **E-commerce-focused comparison sites** (Email Vendor Selection, InsideA Blog) - drove #2 ranking in e-commerce query
3. **Official sources for verification** (klaviyo.com, credential.klaviyo.com, help docs) - cited 16 times in brand-specific query
4. **Specialized review sites** (Email Tool Tester) - trusted for platform comparisons

**Your Citation Alignment:**
- 37 unique URLs cited by Perplexity across 3 queries
- Strong presence on review platforms (G2, Capterra cited consistently)
- Official sources well-indexed
- Gap: No Wikipedia citations despite having article (knowledge graph not leveraged)

### Competitive Intelligence

**Who's Winning AI Citations:**

| Competitor | Perplexity | ChatGPT | Gemini | Avg Position |
|------------|------------|---------|--------|--------------|
| HubSpot | #1 (e-commerce) | #1 | - | 1.0 |
| ActiveCampaign | #3 (e-commerce) | #2 | - | 2.5 |
| MailerLite | #1 (evaluative) | - | - | 1.0 |
| Mailchimp | - | #4 | - | 4.0 |
| **Klaviyo** | #2 (e-commerce) | #5 | - | 3.5 |

**Why Competitors Win:**

**HubSpot (#1 across platforms):**
- Positioned as "comprehensive all-in-one solution" vs. Klaviyo's "e-commerce specialist"
- Broader market appeal (SMB to enterprise)
- Extensive Forbes/major media coverage
- Not siloed into single use case

**MailerLite (#1 in Perplexity evaluative):**
- Free plan heavily emphasized (Klaviyo's free tier undermarketed)
- "Beginner-friendly" positioning captures broad audience
- General-purpose positioning over specialization

**ActiveCampaign (#2-3 range):**
- "Advanced automation" positioning without niche limitation
- Broader applicability than e-commerce-only perception

## THE CONNECTION: How All 3 Steps Link

### Trust Nodes ‚Üí Citation Quality ‚Üí LLM Visibility

**The Chain:**
```
Missing Trust Nodes (Step 1)
    ‚Üì
= Fewer high-quality citations (Step 2)
    ‚Üì
= Lower LLM visibility (Step 3)
```

**Your Specific Chain:**

**Missing Forbes ‚Üí No High-Authority Business Media Citation ‚Üí Lower ChatGPT General Rankings**

Klaviyo ranks #5 on ChatGPT vs. HubSpot #1. Why?
- HubSpot has extensive Forbes, Fast Company, Inc coverage
- These sources are heavily weighted in LLM training data
- Klaviyo's TechCrunch coverage is strong but tech-focused
- Business media gap = perception gap in general business queries

**Trustpilot Polarization ‚Üí Negative Brand Alignment Score ‚Üí "E-commerce specialist" (not leader) Framing**

Perplexity describes Klaviyo as "specializes in e-commerce" vs. HubSpot as "comprehensive"
- 30% negative Trustpilot reviews mention pricing/support issues
- LLMs pick up sentiment signals from review text
- Result: Positioned as capable specialist, not category leader

**No Forbes + "E-commerce Only" Positioning ‚Üí Excluded from Perplexity Evaluative Rankings**

In "What are the top email marketing platforms in 2025?", Klaviyo got contextual mention only:
- Missing Forbes trust node = no citation in evaluative roundups
- Email Vendor Selection (primary source) positioned Klaviyo as niche player
- General platforms (MailerLite, Brevo) dominated main table

## STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### üî¥ IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (This Month)

**Priority 1: Break Out of "E-commerce-Only" Positioning**
- **Current status:** Siloed as "e-commerce specialist" across all LLMs
- **Impact:** Excluded from general evaluative rankings, limits TAM perception, positions against niche competitors instead of category leaders
- **Action:**
  - Update positioning on G2/Capterra from "Best for: E-commerce" to "Best for: B2C businesses scaling customer relationships"
  - Create comparison content showing use cases beyond e-commerce: subscription services, membership organizations, B2C SaaS
  - Target Email Tool Tester and Email Vendor Selection for broader positioning in 2025 roundups
- **Success metric:** Appear in main ranking table (not just contextual mention) in Perplexity evaluative queries within 90 days
- **Timeline:** 2-4 weeks

**Priority 2: Secure Forbes Coverage**
- **Current status:** Completely absent despite $9B valuation, successful IPO
- **Impact:** Forbes is tier-1 citation source for ChatGPT and Perplexity business queries. Absence creates authority gap vs. HubSpot/Salesforce.
- **Action:**
  - Pitch Forbes Cloud 100 list (deadline research needed)
  - Pitch IPO success story angle: "Rare 2023 unicorn IPO that defended valuation"
  - Pitch founder profile on Andrew Bialecki: MIT background, bootstrapped roots, e-commerce specialization strategy
- **Success metric:** 1+ Forbes article published, cited in LLM responses within 180 days
- **Timeline:** 4-6 weeks for pitch, 60-90 days for publication

**Priority 3: Launch Trustpilot Reputation Management Campaign**
- **Current score:** 63% 5-star, 30% 1-star (polarized)
- **Impact:** Negative sentiment weakens brand alignment score (7.0/10), affects LLM tone in descriptions
- **Action:**
  - Respond to all negative reviews (especially pricing/support complaints)
  - Launch customer success story campaign targeting happy customers for reviews
  - Create FAQ/knowledge base addressing top complaints (pricing transparency, support response times)
  - Consider Trustpilot paid features for review management
- **Success metric:** Reduce 1-star reviews to <15%, increase overall rating from current level
- **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks to launch, 90 days to see results
