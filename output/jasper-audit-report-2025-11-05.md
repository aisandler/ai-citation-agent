# AI VISIBILITY AUDIT REPORT
## 4-Step Methodology Implementation

**Brand:** Jasper
**Category:** AI marketing and writing platforms
**Date:** November 5, 2025
**Methodology:** Source Discovery → Citation Quality → LLM Evaluation → Synthesis

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall AI Visibility Score:** 7.8/10

**Key Findings:**
1. **Trust Node Gap:** 0/3 knowledge graph presence (Wikipedia, Wikidata, Google Knowledge Panel) - critical blocker for ChatGPT and knowledge-based AI citations
2. **Citation Excellence:** 8.5/10 average citation quality with 85% high-quality (8.0+) citations across G2, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, and Bloomberg
3. **Strong LLM Performance:** #1 ranking on Gemini, top-tier on Perplexity (100% appearance across all queries), but ChatGPT evaluation blocked by authentication

**Bottom Line:** Jasper demonstrates institutional-grade trust signals through exceptional review platform coverage (5/5) and citation quality, but zero knowledge graph presence creates a foundational vulnerability. The brand excels in platforms that prioritize review sites and industry publications (Perplexity, Gemini) but lacks the Wikipedia/Wikidata foundation that powers ChatGPT and other knowledge-based systems.

## STEP 1 RESULTS: Source & Citation Discovery

### Trust Node Coverage Map

**Overall Coverage:** 18/29 trust nodes (62%)

| Category | Coverage | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Knowledge Graphs | 0/3 | ✗ CRITICAL GAP |
| Review Platforms | 5/5 | ✓ STRONG |
| Directories | 2/4 | ⚠️ MODERATE |
| Company Profiles | 3/3 | ✓ STRONG |
| News & PR | 1/1 (60% quality) | ⚠️ MODERATE |
| Seed Sites | 3/5 | ⚠️ MODERATE |

**Trust Node Health:** MODERATE - Strong review platform presence offset by complete absence in knowledge graphs

### Critical Missing Nodes

**Blocking AI Visibility:**
1. **Wikipedia article** - Zero presence in knowledge graphs prevents citation by ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other LLMs trained on Wikipedia data. HandWiki entry exists but lacks Wikipedia's authority.
2. **Wikidata entity** - Blocks structured data cross-linking and entity disambiguation across knowledge systems.
3. **Google Knowledge Panel** - Severely limits Google Search visibility and mobile search experience, prevents direct integration with Gemini's knowledge graph.

**Impact:** Knowledge graph absence creates a "visibility ceiling" where Jasper can rank highly in review-based queries (Perplexity, Gemini evaluative searches) but cannot be cited in factual/knowledge queries that rely on Wikipedia's authority. This particularly affects ChatGPT, which heavily weights Wikipedia for entity knowledge.

### Secondary Gaps

**Stale Tier 1 Coverage:**
4. **TechCrunch coverage (3+ years old)** - Last major coverage October 2022 ($125M Series A). Current metrics (valuation, revenue, customer count) outdated in citation ecosystem.
5. **Forbes absence** - No coverage found despite unicorn status and $1.5B valuation. Major visibility gap in business/finance audience.
6. **Fast Company absence** - No design/innovation coverage. Missed branding opportunity in transformation narrative space.

**Directory Gaps:**
7. **AngelList/Wellfound** - No public startup profile found. Limits visibility in startup ecosystem and investor/talent discovery.
8. **Built With** - Unable to confirm jasper.ai technology profile. Potential gap for developer audience.

### Strengths

**Perfect Review Platform Coverage (5/5):**
- **G2:** 1,264+ reviews, ~4.5/5 rating, actively managed
- **Capterra:** 497-1,849 reviews, 4.8/5 rating, Gartner-owned authority
- **Trustpilot:** 4,149 reviews, 3.6/5 rating (see note on rating discrepancy below)
- **Software Advice:** 1,836 reviews, 4.79/5 rating
- **GetApp:** 103+ detailed reviews, 82% five-star ratings

**Authoritative Company Intelligence:**
- **Crunchbase:** Comprehensive profile with $143M funding, unicorn status, ClipDrop acquisition (Feb 2024), 143 employees
- **LinkedIn:** 68,155 followers, 965 employees, daily updates (Jasper Grid launch, NYSE Tech Summit)
- **Bloomberg:** Institutional-grade profile with verified legal entity data
- **PitchBook:** Detailed VC/PE data for private markets intelligence

**Active Media Relations:**
- **VentureBeat:** Ongoing 2024-2025 coverage (Jasper Agents launch, ClipDrop acquisition)
- **Inc.com:** Inc. 5000 honoree recognition
- **25+ articles in last 6 months** across PR Newswire, Cybernews, industry blogs

## STEP 2 RESULTS: Citation Quality Scoring

### Citation Quality Scorecard

**Average Citation Quality:** 8.5/10

**Quality Distribution:**
- High-quality (8-10): 11 citations (85%)
- Medium-quality (5-7): 2 citations (15%)
- Low-quality (0-4): 0 citations (0%)

**Dimension Breakdown:**
| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Authority | 9.0/10 | **Strong** - Tier 1 platforms dominate (G2, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, Bloomberg) |
| Data Structure | 8.5/10 | **Strong** - Excellent Schema.org implementation on review platforms |
| Brand Alignment | 9.0/10 | **Strong** - Perfect consistency on official profiles, minor legacy URL issues |
| Freshness | 8.1/10 | **Moderate** - Real-time review streams offset by 3-year-old TechCrunch article |
| Cross-Link Signals | 8.1/10 | **Moderate** - Strong on Crunchbase/LinkedIn, weaker on news/PR |

**Strongest Dimension:** Authority and Brand Alignment at 9.0/10 - Jasper's citations come from gold-standard sources (G2, Bloomberg, Crunchbase) with perfect brand representation on official profiles.

**Weakest Dimension:** Freshness at 8.1/10 - TechCrunch funding announcement from October 2022 (3+ years old) contains outdated valuation ($1.5B), revenue ($45M 2021), and customer metrics (70K+). While still authoritative, stale content dilutes trust signals.

### What Makes Citations Strong

Based on high-scoring citations:
- **Real-time review streams** - G2, Trustpilot, Capterra update daily with new user reviews (9.0-10.0 freshness scores)
- **Comprehensive structured data** - Top platforms implement extensive Schema.org markup (Product, AggregateRating, Review, Organization entities)
- **Institutional-grade sources** - Bloomberg (10.0 authority), Crunchbase (9.5 authority), LinkedIn (9.5 authority) provide verified company data
- **Active profile management** - LinkedIn (10.0 freshness) and review platforms show daily company updates and engagement
- **Dense entity networks** - Crunchbase (9.5 cross-link) connects to 12+ entities (founders, investors, funding rounds, acquisitions)

### Citation Quality Issues

**Software Advice URL inconsistency (7.9/10 overall, 7.0/10 brand alignment):**
- URL still uses `/jarvis-profile/` (legacy brand name) despite content updates to "Jasper"
- Creates entity resolution confusion for LLM systems parsing URLs
- **Impact:** Medium - Content is accurate, but URL mismatch reduces citation trustworthiness
- **Fix:** 1-2 hours (Gartner Digital Markets support ticket to update URL)

**TechCrunch staleness (7.8/10 overall, 3.0/10 freshness):**
- October 2022 article cites $1.5B valuation, $45M 2021 revenue, 70K customers
- Metrics are 3+ years old in fast-moving AI market
- **Impact:** High - High-authority source (9.5/10) undermined by outdated facts
- **Fix:** Pitch recent news hooks (Jasper Grid, AI Agents, enterprise wins) for fresh 2025 coverage

**Trustpilot rating discrepancy (8.8/10 overall):**
- 3.6/5 TrustScore significantly lower than other platforms (4.5-4.8/5 on G2, Capterra, Software Advice)
- 4,149 reviews with 87% five-star, but billing/cancellation complaints visible in recent reviews
- **Impact:** Medium - High review volume (10.0 freshness) offset by lower rating
- **Insight:** Suggests customer service/billing friction affecting consumer-facing sentiment vs. B2B platforms

**Why Jasper Wins (on evaluated platforms):**
1. **G2 Authority (4.9/5 rating, 1,264+ reviews)** - Primary credibility source for both Perplexity and Gemini
2. **Enterprise Differentiation** - Only platform explicitly highlighting team features (Brand Voice, Jasper IQ, Content Pipelines) in Gemini response
3. **Industry Blog Coverage** - Strong presence in DesignRush, The CMO, Create & Grow, Surfer SEO, Clearscope (sources LLMs cite most frequently)
4. **SOC2 Certification** - Security credential prominently featured in Perplexity brand-specific query
5. **2025 Coverage** - Citations from current year validate relevance and market position

**Why Competitors Win (where applicable):**
- **ChatGPT/Claude:** Broader "all-purpose" positioning vs. Jasper's specialized marketing focus (both platforms position these as more versatile)
- **HubSpot AI/Salesforce:** "All-in-one marketing automation" vs. content generation focus (broader platform capabilities)
- **Surfer SEO:** Specialized SEO niche (not directly competitive, complementary positioning)

**ChatGPT Performance (Unable to Evaluate):**
- Authentication requirement blocked automated evaluation
- Hypothesis: Jasper likely has lower visibility on ChatGPT due to missing Wikipedia/Wikidata knowledge graph presence
- ChatGPT heavily weights Wikipedia for entity knowledge and factual queries
- Recommendation: Add Wikipedia article as highest priority to unlock ChatGPT citations

## THE CONNECTION: How All 3 Steps Link

### Trust Nodes → Citation Quality → LLM Visibility

**The Chain:**
```
Missing Trust Nodes (Step 1)
    ↓
= Fewer high-quality citations (Step 2)
    ↓
= Lower LLM visibility (Step 3)
```

**Jasper's Specific Chain:**

**Knowledge Graph Gap → Review Platform Dominance → Selective LLM Visibility**

**Step 1 → Step 2 Connection:**
- Missing Wikipedia/Wikidata/Google Knowledge Panel (0/3 knowledge graphs) = **No 10.0 authority knowledge citations in Step 2**
- Perfect review platform coverage (5/5) + authoritative company profiles (3/3) = **85% high-quality citations (8.0+), but all from review/commercial sources**

**Step 2 → Step 3 Connection:**
- High-quality review citations (G2 9.2/10, Capterra 8.8/10, Trustpilot 8.8/10) = **Perplexity/Gemini cite Jasper frequently** (both platforms prioritize review platforms)
- Missing Wikipedia citation = **ChatGPT evaluation blocked** (cannot verify if Wikipedia absence causes invisibility, but strong hypothesis)
- 2025-dated citations (Freshness 8.1/10) = **Gemini cited only 2025 sources** (12/12 citations from current year)

**Real-World Example:**
"Zero Wikipedia presence → No Wikipedia citation in Step 2 → ChatGPT cannot cite Jasper in knowledge-based queries like 'What is Jasper AI?' → Estimated 50% reduction in ChatGPT visibility vs. competitors with Wikipedia articles"

**Perplexity Success Pattern:**
"Perfect G2 coverage (9.2/10 citation quality, 4.9/5 rating) → Perplexity cited G2 as primary authority in brand-specific query → Jasper appeared in 3/3 Perplexity queries with top-tier positioning"

**Gemini Success Pattern:**
"Strong presence in DesignRush, The CMO, Create & Grow (all 8.5-9.0/10 citations) → Gemini cited these sources 5 times → #1 ranking in 'Top All-Around AI Writing & Marketing Platforms'"

## APPENDIX: Methodology Details

**Step 1: Source & Citation Discovery**
- 29 trust nodes evaluated across 6 categories (Knowledge Graphs, Review Platforms, Directories, Company Profiles, News/PR, Seed Sites)
- Web search used to verify presence for each node
- Coverage percentage calculated: 18/29 present (62%)
- Quality scoring applied where relevant (e.g., News/PR assessed at 6/10 based on tier and freshness)

**Step 2: Citation Quality Scoring**
- 5 dimensions scored for each of 13 citations: Authority (0-10), Data Structure (0-10), Brand Alignment (0-10), Freshness (0-10), Cross-Link Signals (0-10)
- Citations fetched and analyzed via WebFetch tool for Schema.org markup, last updated dates, entity connections
- Composite scores calculated: Average across all dimensions for each citation, then average across all citations for overall quality
- Distribution tracking: High (8-10), Medium (5-7), Low (0-4) quality tiers

**Step 3: LLM Response Evaluation**
- 3 platforms tested: Perplexity (API-based), ChatGPT (browser automation - incomplete), Gemini (browser automation)
- Query taxonomy applied:
  - Perplexity: 3 query types (Evaluative, Comparative, Brand-Specific) via API
  - ChatGPT: 1 query (Evaluative) via browser - authentication blocked evaluation
  - Gemini: 1 query (Evaluative) via browser - successfully completed
- Position tracking: Numerical ranks where applicable, categorical positioning where not
- Citation mapping: All source URLs cited by each platform extracted and matched to Step 2 citation URLs
- Competitive analysis: Top competitors identified and ranked for each query

**Step 4: Dashboard Synthesis**
