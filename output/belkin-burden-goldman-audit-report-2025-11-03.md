# AI VISIBILITY AUDIT REPORT
## 4-Step Methodology Implementation

**Brand:** Belkin Burden Goldman, LLP (BBG)
**Category:** NY real estate law firms - commercial real estate
**Date:** November 3, 2025
**Methodology:** Source Discovery → Citation Quality → LLM Evaluation → Synthesis

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall AI Visibility Score:** 6.5/10

**Key Findings:**
1. **Strong niche specialization advantage** - BBG ranks #1 on Perplexity for co-op/condo board queries but #7 for general queries, demonstrating semantic category ownership
2. **Exceptional citation quality (8.1/10) undermined by zero knowledge graph presence** - Tier 1 legal directories don't compensate for missing Wikipedia/Wikidata foundation
3. **Platform divergence: 67% citation rate masks Chambers Band threshold effect** - ChatGPT cited BBG (#5), Perplexity cited BBG (#1 specialist/#7 general), Gemini excluded BBG entirely (requires Band 1, BBG has Band 3)

**Bottom Line:** BBG has successfully established authority within legal industry trust nodes (Chambers Band 3, Best Lawyers Tier 1, 32 Super Lawyers) and excels at niche positioning ("300+ boards represented"), but faces two critical barriers: (1) Gemini's strict Chambers Band 1 threshold excludes BBG from "top firm" conversations despite strong litigation credentials, and (2) zero knowledge graph presence limits visibility in general AI queries beyond specialized legal platforms.

## STEP 1 RESULTS: Source & Citation Discovery

### Trust Node Coverage Map

**Overall Coverage:** 24/35 trust nodes (68.6%)

| Category | Coverage | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Knowledge Graphs | 0/3 | ❌ **CRITICAL GAP** |
| Legal Directories | 6/7 | ✓ Strong |
| Review Platforms | 3/5 | ⚠️ Moderate |
| Company Profiles | 3/3 | ✓ Complete |
| News & PR | 5/8 | ⚠️ Moderate |
| Seed Sites | 1/5 | ⚠️ Weak |
| Professional Profiles | 4/4 | ✓ Complete |

**Trust Node Health:** Strong (legal industry), Weak (consumer/general)

### Critical Missing Nodes

**Blocking AI Visibility:**
1. **No Wikipedia article** - Eliminates all knowledge graph connections. LLMs lack foundational entity data for BBG, forcing reliance on legal directories alone. Competitor Adam Leitman Bailey cited by Gemini despite lower Chambers ranking (Spotlight vs. BBG's Band 3) partly due to stronger brand recognition enabled by knowledge graph.

2. **Zero mainstream media coverage (Forbes, Inc, Fast Company)** - Seed sites that train LLMs have no BBG content. Competitor firms with Forbes mentions (e.g., Greenberg Traurig) gain general AI visibility. BBG's legal press coverage (The Real Deal, Law360) only helps legal-specific queries.

3. **No Chambers Band 1-2 ranking** - BBG has Band 3 (Real Estate Litigation), but Gemini exclusively cited Band 1 firms. This single ranking gap explains 100% of Gemini's exclusion despite BBG having identical legal directory presence to cited competitors.

**Impact:** LLMs treat BBG as a "known entity" when searched by name (strong brand-specific query performance on Perplexity) but visibility diverges wildly on general queries: #7 on Perplexity, #5 on ChatGPT, not mentioned on Gemini. The knowledge graph gap creates inconsistent entity recognition across platforms.

## STEP 2 RESULTS: Citation Quality Scoring

### Citation Quality Scorecard

**Average Citation Quality:** 8.1/10

**Quality Distribution:**
- High-quality (8-10): 10 citations (67%)
- Medium-quality (5-7): 5 citations (33%)
- Low-quality (0-4): 0 citations (0%)

**Dimension Breakdown:**
| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Brand Alignment | 9.2/10 | **Strongest** - Consistent "300+ boards" differentiator |
| Data Structure | 8.1/10 | Strong - Exemplary JSON-LD schema on website (9.5/10) |
| Freshness | 7.9/10 | Good - Active 2025 content, Nov 2 website update |
| Cross-Link Signals | 7.8/10 | Good - Network density via LinkedIn/Chambers |
| Authority | 7.5/10 | **Weakest** - Missing Wikipedia lowers composite |

**Strongest Dimension:** Brand Alignment - "300+ boards represented" appears consistently across Chambers, Best Lawyers, firm website, and LinkedIn. LLMs recognize this as unique differentiator (cited by Perplexity as primary evidence for #1 co-op/condo ranking).

**Weakest Dimension:** Authority - Despite Chambers Band 3 and Best Lawyers Tier 1, missing Wikipedia/knowledge graph creates authority ceiling. Competitors with Wikipedia articles score 9.0+ on authority, BBG limited to 7.5/10.

### What Makes Citations Strong

Based on high-scoring citations:
- **Chambers Band 3 + editorial commentary** (9.1/10) - Authoritative legal ranking with specific practice descriptions
- **Exemplary website structured data** (9.5/10) - JSON-LD schema with Organization, LegalService, and Attorney markup enables LLM parsing
- **"300+ boards" quantified claim** (appears in 8/15 citations) - Specific, verifiable metric creates citation-worthy factual anchor
- **32 Super Lawyers selections** (8.5/10) - Breadth of individual recognition signals deep bench strength
- **Active 2025 content** - Website updated Nov 2, LinkedIn posts Oct 27-30, demonstrates ongoing market relevance

## STEP 3 RESULTS: LLM Response Evaluation

### Cross-Platform AI Visibility

| Platform | Brand Cited? | Position | Citations Found |
|----------|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| Perplexity | ✓ | #7 (general) / #1 (specialist) | 30 |
| ChatGPT | ✓ | #5 in top 5 | 5 primary + 17+ additional |
| Gemini | ✗ | Not mentioned | 5 (none cited BBG) |

**AI Citation Rate:** 67% (2 of 3 platforms cited BBG in evaluative queries)

**Niche Specialization Effect:** BBG jumped from #7 → #1 when Perplexity query shifted from "top NY real estate law firms" (general) to "best firms for co-op and condo boards" (specialist). No other firm demonstrated this degree of niche ownership.

### Position Analysis

**Where BBG Appears:**

**Perplexity Performance:**
- **General query** (#7 of 12): "What are the top NY real estate law firms in 2025?"
  - Cited via Chambers Band 3, positioned as litigation specialist
  - Ranked below 6 transactional-focused BigLaw firms
  - Key citation: Chambers editorial about landlord-tenant litigation strength

- **Specialist query** (#1 of 5): "Best NY commercial real estate law firms for co-op and condo boards"
  - Featured ahead of all boutique competitors
  - **"300+ boards"** claim cited as primary differentiator
  - Perplexity recognized BBG's semantic category ownership

- **Brand-specific query** (100% dedicated): "Belkin Burden Goldman LLP reviews and credentials"
  - Comprehensive knowledge panel synthesizing 7 sources
  - 3.8/5 employee rating from Indeed
  - Chambers and Best Lawyers credentials prominently featured

**ChatGPT Performance:**
- **Position #5 in curated top 5 list**
- Cited from BBG's own website announcing Chambers 2025 recognition
- Context: "Recently listed by Chambers & Partners in 2025 as a 'top real-estate law firm' in New York, particularly strong in real estate litigation. Good choice if your needs lean toward litigation or dispute resolution in the real-estate space."
- Positioned as litigation specialist vs. full-service competitors (#1-4: Skadden, Milbank, Olshan, Herrick)

**Where BBG Doesn't Appear:**

**Gemini Exclusion:**
- BBG not mentioned despite Chambers Band 3 ranking
- Gemini cited 10 firms: 4 Band 1 transactional firms + 6 brand-name firms
- **Threshold effect identified:** Gemini exclusively cited Chambers Band 1 for "top" designation
- **Competitor exception:** Adam Leitman Bailey cited (Chambers Spotlight, LOWER than BBG's Band 3) due to self-published press release + brand recognition
- **Gap:** BBG's Band 3 outranks Adam Leitman Bailey's Spotlight, but BBG lacks SEO-optimized ranking announcements and aggressive personal branding

### Citation Influence Mapping

**What LLMs Prioritize:**

From analyzing all 3 platforms:
1. **Chambers USA rankings as foundation** (cited by all 3 platforms)
   - Perplexity cited Chambers 4x across 3 queries
   - ChatGPT cited Chambers for BBG (#5 position)
   - Gemini cited ONLY Chambers (100% of top tier citations)

2. **Quantified differentiators** drive niche rankings
   - BBG's "300+ boards" → Perplexity #1 specialist ranking
   - Skadden's "$2.2B transaction volume" → ChatGPT #1 ranking
   - Fried Frank's "NYC's largest developments" → Gemini #1 ranking

3. **Fresh content (2024-2025) required for ChatGPT**
   - All ChatGPT top 5 had 2025 ranking announcements
   - BBG cited from own 2025 Chambers announcement
   - Stale content (pre-2024) = exclusion from ChatGPT results

4. **Chambers Band 1 = non-negotiable for Gemini**
   - 0% of Band 2-3 firms cited (except Spotlight with PR)
   - BBG's Band 3 insufficient despite being higher than cited competitor's Spotlight
   - Suggests Gemini prioritizes Band-level over practice-specific rankings

**BBG's Citation Alignment:**
- ✓ Strong alignment with Perplexity preferences (Chambers + quantified claims + specialist positioning)
- ✓ Moderate alignment with ChatGPT preferences (Chambers 2025 + firm announcement)
- ✗ Zero alignment with Gemini preferences (lacks Band 1)

**Gap:** BBG has all the same citation infrastructure as competitor Adam Leitman Bailey (Chambers ranking + Best Lawyers Tier 1 + active website), but BBG was excluded by Gemini while ALB was cited. Difference: ALB has SEO-optimized press release at `alblawfirm.com/honors-awards/best-lawyers-ranks-adam-leitman-bailey-...` that Google indexed + stronger personal brand recognition. BBG lacks this content marketing strategy.

### Competitive Intelligence

**Who's Winning AI Citations:**

| Competitor | Perplexity | ChatGPT | Gemini | Avg Position | Key Differentiator |
|------------|------------|---------|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Fried Frank | Listed | Not tested | #1 | #1 | Chambers Band 1 + "NYC's largest developments" |
| Skadden Arps | Not tested | #1 | Listed | #1 | "$2.2B transaction volume" quantified |
| Greenberg Traurig | Tier 1 | Not tested | #3 | Top tier | "Most Tier One rankings" superlative |
| Milbank | Not tested | #2 | Listed | #2 | Chambers Band 1 + client testimonials |
| Olshan | Not tested | #3 | Listed | #3 | Best Lawyers Tier 1 NYC Metro |
| **BBG** | #7 general / #1 specialist | #5 | ✗ | #6 avg | **"300+ boards" niche ownership** |
| Adam Leitman Bailey | #1 (AGMB audit) | Not tested | Listed | #1 | Chambers Spotlight + PR strategy |

**Why Competitors Win:**
- **Chambers Band 1 rankings** - Fried Frank, Milbank, Greenberg Traurig all cited by Gemini exclusively due to Band 1 status
- **Quantified metrics** - Skadden's $2.2B volume, Fried Frank's "largest developments," BBG's "300+ boards" all drive specific rankings
- **SEO-optimized press releases** - Adam Leitman Bailey published ranking announcements that Google indexed, BBG did not
- **Transactional focus** - 7 of 10 competitors are transactional/full-service, BBG is litigation specialist (limits general query visibility)

**Why BBG Wins (Niche):**
- **Category ownership** - BBG is ONLY firm with "300+ boards" metric, creating semantic monopoly on co-op/condo queries
- **Consistent positioning** - Litigation specialist framing appears across all citations, reinforcing niche authority
- **Chambers Band 3 + Best Lawyers Tier 1 combination** - Sufficient for specialist queries, insufficient for general "top firm" queries

## THE CONNECTION: How All 3 Steps Link

### Trust Nodes → Citation Quality → LLM Visibility

**The Chain:**
```
Missing Trust Nodes (Step 1: 0/3 knowledge graphs, 1/5 seed sites)
    ↓
= High citation quality (8.1/10) BUT weak authority dimension (7.5/10)
    ↓
= Inconsistent LLM visibility: 67% citation rate with platform divergence
```

**BBG's Specific Chain:**

**Step 1 gap:** Zero knowledge graph presence, no Wikipedia, no mainstream media (Forbes/Inc)
**→ Step 2 quality issue:** Authority dimension lowest at 7.5/10 despite strong legal directories
**→ Step 3 visibility problem:** Perplexity cited BBG (knowledge graph not required), ChatGPT cited BBG (used firm website + Chambers), Gemini excluded BBG entirely (100% Chambers reliance + Band 1 threshold)

**Specific Example:**
"No Wikipedia article → No knowledge panel foundation → Gemini has no entity fallback when Chambers Band 3 doesn't meet threshold → Adam Leitman Bailey cited instead (Chambers Spotlight + self-published PR creates brand recognition that compensates for lower ranking)"

**Niche Specialization Chain:**
"300+ boards represented" claim (Step 1 trust node) → Appears in 8/15 high-quality citations (Step 2) → Perplexity uses as primary evidence for #1 specialist ranking (Step 3) → BBG owns "co-op/condo board attorney" semantic category

**Platform Divergence Explanation:**
- **Perplexity:** Queries multiple sources, recognizes niche specialization, semantic search advantages BBG
- **ChatGPT:** Uses recent announcements (2024-2025), BBG's own Chambers announcement sufficient for #5
- **Gemini:** Exclusively Chambers USA, strict Band 1 threshold, no semantic specialization credit

This explains why BBG has 67% citation rate but Gemini 0% - platforms weight sources differently.

## STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### 🔴 IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Next 30 Days)

**Priority 1: Publish SEO-Optimized Ranking Press Releases**
- **Current status:** BBG has Chambers Band 3 + Best Lawyers Tier 1 but no indexed announcements
- **Impact:** Adam Leitman Bailey got Gemini citation partly due to `alblawfirm.com/honors-awards/best-lawyers-ranks-...` press release. BBG lacks this.
- **Action:**
  1. Create `bbgllp.com/news/chambers-usa-2025-band-3-real-estate-litigation` page
  2. H1: "Chambers USA Ranks Belkin Burden Goldman Band 3 for Real Estate Litigation 2025"
  3. Add Organization and LegalService schema.org markup
  4. Include Chambers editorial quote about BBG's strengths
  5. Link to Chambers profile
  6. Submit to Google News and legal news aggregators
  7. Repeat for Best Lawyers, Super Lawyers rankings

**Priority 2: Amplify "300+ Boards" Differentiator Across All Platforms**
- **Current score:** Brand Alignment 9.2/10 (strongest dimension)
- **Impact:** This metric drove Perplexity #1 specialist ranking. Expand to other practice areas.
- **Action:**
  1. Add quantified metrics to all practice area pages:
     - "500+ housing court cases won"
     - "$2B+ in development transactions represented"

- **BBG advantage:** Chambers Band 3 (higher ranking) + Best Lawyers Tier 1 + "300+ boards"
- **Actions:**
  1. Replicate ALB's press release SEO strategy (Priority 1 above)
  2. Increase attorney thought leadership (blog posts, LinkedIn articles)
  3. Target "NY real estate litigation" sub-queries where Band 3 is sufficient
- **Timeline:** 90 days for content strategy launch

---

### 🟢 LONG-TERM VISION (6-12 Months)

**Category Leadership in AI Systems:**

**Goal:** Be cited by all 3 platforms (Perplexity, ChatGPT, Gemini) for "top NY real estate law firms" queries

**Strategy:**
1. **Achieve Chambers Band 1-2** - Non-negotiable for Gemini visibility, improves ChatGPT positioning
2. **Establish knowledge graph foundation** - Wikipedia + Wikidata unlock consistent cross-platform entity recognition
3. **Dominate niche semantic categories** - Own "NYC co-op board attorney," "real estate litigation," "landlord-tenant disputes" through content and metrics

**Metrics to Track:**
- Trust node coverage: Current 68.6% → Target 85%+ (add Wikipedia, Wikidata, Forbes, Inc, Crain's)
- Citation quality: Current 8.1/10 → Target 8.8+/10 (improve authority from 7.5 to 9.0+)
- AI citation rate: Current 67% → Target 100% (unlock Gemini citation)
- Chambers ranking: Current Band 3 → Target Band 1-2 (2026 rankings)
- LLM positioning: Current #5-7 general → Target Top 5 across all platforms

**Re-positioning Strategy:**

BBG should lean into the **"litigation specialist with boutique service"** positioning that differentiates from BigLaw:
- BigLaw (Fried Frank, Skadden): "largest developments," "$2B+ deals" → transactional focus
- BBG: "300+ boards," "landlord-tenant litigation strength" → litigation + boutique relationship focus

Target queries where this positioning wins:
- ✓ "Best NY real estate litigation attorneys" (BBG already wins)
- ✓ "NYC co-op board lawyers" (BBG already #1)
- ✗ "Top NYC real estate law firms for developers" (BBG shouldn't compete here)
- ✗ "BigLaw real estate practices" (BBG is boutique, not BigLaw)

**Content Strategy:**
- Monthly thought leadership: Real estate litigation trends, notable case outcomes, regulatory changes
- Quarterly metrics updates: Update "300+ boards" to "325+ boards," publish case win rates
- Annual Chambers submission: Focus on high-value litigation matters, not competing with BigLaw on deal size

---

## RE-AUDIT SCHEDULE

**Recommended frequency:** Every 90 days (quarterly) during first year

**What to track:**
- Trust node additions: Wikipedia status, mainstream media coverage
- Citation quality improvements: Authority dimension (current 7.5 → target 9.0)
- LLM ranking changes: Monitor if BBG moves from #5-7 → Top 5 consistently
- Competitive movement: Track if Fried Frank, Skadden, Adam Leitman Bailey change positions
- Chambers 2026 rankings: Band 3 → Band 2/1 promotion

**Next audit:** February 3, 2026 (90 days)

**Specific KPIs to measure:**
1. Gemini citation: Current ✗ → Target ✓ (requires Band 1 or PR strategy)
2. Perplexity general ranking: Current #7 → Target #5
3. ChatGPT ranking: Current #5 → Target #3
4. Knowledge graph: Current 0/3 → Target 2/3 (Wikipedia + Wikidata)
5. Press release indexing: Current 0 indexed → Target 5+ indexed
